<p>Man has been in all ages and countries,
in a greater or less degree, the
victim of imposture and superstition.
Their origin can every where be traced
to rude and uncultivated periods
of society; but subsequent stages of
comparative elegance and refinement
have also ministered to the support
of their dominion. Egypt, Greece
and Rome were successively the
seats of learning and science; yet in
these celebrated regions, the human
mind was enveloped in darkness and
loaded with chains. The Egyptians
have this ancient proverb: "It is easier
to find a deity than a man."&mdash;Apotheosis
must have been carried
to an extraordinary length indeed
when this was the case. Among
these deities, Isis was prominently
distinguished, and universally worshipped.
On her statues, these words
were impudently inscribed: "I am
all that has been, that shall be, and
none among mortals has hitherto taken
off my veil!" Who but would
blush for the credulity which listened
with reverential awe to the oracular
responses at Delphi, a town situate
in the neighbourhood of Mount
Parnassus, believed by every one at
that time to be the centre of the earth!
And concerning this precious object,
the wars denominated the "<em>sacred</em>
wars," were so furiously and destructively
waged. The Grecians were
compelled, under pain of death, rigidly
to observe the mysteries of Eleusis;
and the wisest of the Romans
were seen consulting the flight of
birds and the entrails of animals, for
infallible prognostics of future events.
Where the footsteps of <em>true</em> philosophy
can be traced, her triumphs have
been signal; and having found most
of these and many other errors exploded,
we lay claim in this enlightened
age and country, to an extraordinary
exemption from the influence
of imposture and superstition.
Although the darkness and gloom of
former ages have in a great degree
fled at the approach of the light of
knowledge, still here and there the
skirts of a black cloud remain, to indicate
the failure of an absolute conquest.
And the presence of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
potent adversaries of human happiness,
should inculcate the duty on
every friend of his species of lending
his aid in advancing the cause of
<span class="smcap">TRUTH</span>.</p>

<p>Among the reprehensible customs
which now obtain in the United States,
none are more affrontful to the good
sense of the community, and few more
pernicious in their effects on youth
and inexperience, than <span class="smcap">LOTTERIES</span>,
and the disgusting advertisements
connected with them, which daily appear
in the public journals. The
funds which constitute a lottery, are
principally derived from the pockets
of those whose straitened circumstances,
prompt them to grasp at the
glittering phantoms, paraded before
their eyes by professional jugglers.&mdash;Their
minds become unsettled; a
love of idleness and extravagance is
excited; and their attention diverted
from the true sources of prosperity&mdash;industry,
frugality and sound morals.
This cautionary advice may be deduced
from the best and brightest of
books; "Make not haste to be
rich."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Experience and observation
unite in confirming its wisdom. We
need but contemplate the consequences,
which have almost universally
resulted to those who have been
so <em>fortunate</em> as to draw large prizes!
Nine times perhaps out of ten, bankruptcy
and ruin have trodden close
on the heels of the dissipation and
thoughtlessness they have occasioned.
Lotteries are made by legislation,
(which ought to be much better employed,)
a species of legalized gambling,
altogether destitute, in every
point of view, of the slightest recommendation,
to the countenance and
patronage of the public. Being thus
prejudicial to individual and social
happiness, is it not to be lamented,
that respectable editors instead of
branding it as they ought, with its
proper characteristics; should, to
augment the profits of their papers,
give to this system of deception, the
widest circulation, among all classes
of readers. These gentlemen should
remember, that pecuniary sacrifices
should sometimes be made at the
shrine of virtue.</p>

<p>Another source of imposture may
be traced to the venders of <span class="smcap">QUACK
MEDICINES</span>. Few persons are, perhaps,
aware of the amount of this
tax, levied by unprincipled charlatans,
on the afflicted and credulous
portion of the community. But it is
not their money only that is sacrificed,
but frequently their constitutions
and their lives. He, whose constant
companions have long been Pain and
Disease, is easily persuaded to listen
to the confident promises of impudent
pretenders to medical science.
He indulges the flattering but false
anticipation of returning health, until
his symptoms assume an incurable
character, and nature gives him the
"signal for retreat." It is not to be
expected, that for all the multiform
shapes which vice is constantly assuming,
remedies can be furnished by
statutory provision. For many evils,
and some of them of a positively mischievous
character, no other cure can
be relied on with certainty, than the
virtue and intelligence of the public.
In proportion as these shall be cultivated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
will be the augmentation of social
enjoyment, and the increasing
splendour of the orb of truth.</p>

<p>It has been observed by an eminent
writer, that although all argument
is against the existence of
GHOSTS, all opinion is in its favour.&mdash;The
celebrated <span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>, it is
said, believed in them; and <span class="smcap">Edward
Cave</span> asserted confidently, though he
avoided dwelling on the subject, that
he had himself seen an apparition.&mdash;The
story of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Veal</span>, prefixed to
Drelincourt on Death, though not
conclusive, tended to strengthen such
opinions. Few of those who held
them, were countenanced by stronger
evidence than that detailed in the following
authentic narrative. In the
earlier periods of the settlement of
Pennsylvania, public houses of entertainment
were few and distant from
each other. A farmer, who resided
in Montgomery then Philadelphia
county, was returning from market
at a late hour, of a cold winter night.
As he was passing a meeting house,
he discovered through the interstices
of the door, a light which proceeded
from a fire-place; there having been
public worship held there during the
preceding day. Having dismounted
and hitched his horse, he proceeded to
the door, and having opened it, beheld
a large fire burning, a man laying
before it, and between this mysterious
personage and the door, a coffin! He
instinctively shrunk back, as the time,
the place, and the circumstances he
witnessed, were well calculated to
produce considerable excitement.&mdash;Summoning
his resolution, however,
he advanced to the fire-place, where
he found a person asleep, and a new
coffin along side of him. The man
informed him, that being a joiner, he
was employed to make a coffin for a
relation who died a few miles above,
and that he was taking it up from
Germantown where he resided. It
appeared that they had both turned in
with the same object, to warm themselves;
and the honest farmer was
pleased to find the spectral apparition
subside into a sober reality. How fortunate
would it be if on all occasions,
investigation were equally honest and
determined. Then, indeed, would
error and falsehood frequently be
forced to "<span class="smcap">SHAME AND LIGHT</span>."</p>

<h2>THE VILLAGE TEACHER.</h2>


<p>My favourite occupation between
school hours, during the Spring and
Summer, is <span class="smcap">GARDENING</span>. The munificence
of some village Lorenzo has
bequeathed, for the use of the schoolmaster,
several acres of ground, well
situated for tillage or ornamental
purposes. Since I have been the
incumbent, I have taken much pains
to improve it by surrounding the chief
part with hedges of cedar and thorn,
and planting a good selection of fruit
and forest trees. The lower part of
the field is in grass, and a winding
gravel walk leads from one group of
trees to another. Here, according to
their various tastes and habits, may
be seen the magnolias of our own
and the southern states, the walnut,
the locust, the elm, the tulip tree, and
the different varieties of pine, and
larch, and fir, which it has been my
study to arrange so as to diversify the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
view, and exhibit as much as my slender
means would allow, the great families
into which the vegetable kingdom
is divided. A brook as clear as
crystal babbles along through an adjoining
lot, and enters mine towards
the lower end. I have conducted it
to a natural hollow in the ground,
and have thus, at a trifling expense,
formed a fish-pond, which adds greatly
to the beauty of my little domain,
and furnishes me not only with wholesome
food for my own and my friends'
tables, but is well suited, from the natural
moisture of its banks, for the
cultivation of many of our beautiful
ferns and aquatic plants. The middle
of the lot I have planted with the
various fruit trees in which our climate
is so rich, if, indeed, it may not
challenge a competition in this respect
with the world. The upper
and smaller portion of the lot, I have
appropriated to what is called gardening
in the stricter sense of the
word. In marking out the walks, I
have endeavoured to follow, as nearly
as I could, what the painters, perhaps
a little fantastically, call the line
of beauty, so as to have but few sharp
corners or square beds. At the prominent
angles and the centres of the
beds, are planted the Rhododendron;
the two Kalmias; the scarlet, the
tri-coloured and the flowering Azaleas;
the Clethra and the Philadelphus,
mingling with the most beautiful
of the domesticated foreign shrubbery&mdash;the
different Roses, Honeysuckles,
and Jessamines. Underneath,
and among this shrubbery, are
seen the blue and scarlet Lobelias,
the native Lily, the Gerardia, the
Arethusa, the Orchis, the Bartsia,
the Epigea, and all those beautiful
flowers that spring up in our woods
and meadows, and so frequently
bloom and die unseen or unappropriated.
These native flowers make
a fine show and not an unfavourable
comparison even with those beauties
of Europe and the East that I have
been able to collect and arrange by
their side.</p>

<p>I have been thus particular and
egotistical in describing my garden,
perhaps from vanity, but partly from
a wish that the plan may be followed.
Our native shrubbery and flowers are
not surpassed in beauty and splendour
by those of any region in the temperate
zone, and many of them in magnificence
of foliage and colours are
truly tropical. They are sought for
abroad with great eagerness, and form
an indispensable part of every gentleman's
collection. I wish it were
more the custom for our farmers and
cottagers to domesticate them in their
gardens and around their houses.&mdash;They
improve materially by cultivation,
and new varieties are frequently
formed. What can be a more beautiful
ornament to the front of a farm-house,
or a neat white-washed cottage,
than a Sweet-briar, winding between
the windows and over the door?
or the Carolina Passion flower, the
Alleghany Vine, the Clematis, or the
scarlet Trumpet flower? These rural
decorations add more than one
would imagine, who had not tried
them, to the innocent pleasures of a
family; they have no small influence
in forming the taste of children; they
form a favourite retreat for the birds;
and they fling over the whole country
an air of peace, and contentment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and innocent enjoyment, which no
one, who has not travelled in the more
beautiful and retired parts of England,
can fully appreciate.</p>

<p>I recollect once in riding through
the valley of Chester county with some
foreign gentlemen, that they were
struck with the nakedness and rudeness
of the farm-houses. It appeared
to them the most beautiful region
they had ever seen, and they exclaimed,
with one voice, that the inhabitants
did not seem worthy of possessing
it. On the side of some sloping
hill and in front of a lawn as smooth
as velvet, or laden with the riches of
the harvest, would be seen a barn and
a house that looked as if the master
and horse had changed lodgings, both
of rude unhewn stone, without a single
tree, or shrub, or a trailing vine, for
shade or ornament. Such an insensibility
to the beauties of rural decoration,
in a region where every thing
seems calculated to call out and
quicken the taste, is unnatural, and
can only arise from sordid habits or
ignorance.</p>

<p>If these hasty remarks should call
the attention of our farmers to the
subject, and induce them to devote
some of their leisure hours to the ornamenting
of their grounds, I shall
be richly rewarded; and I can promise
to them also a rich reward.&mdash;Their
houses will be more cool and
healthful, and they will find that by
encouraging in their children a taste
for gardening, and for observing the
native beauties of our forests, their
fondness for the innocent pleasures of
home and for reading will be increased,
together with that unambitious
ease and industry which form the
distinguishing traits in the character
of a virtuous peasantry.</p>

<p>I began this paper with a design
to eulogise the art of gardening, and
investigate its effects on the mind. I
have been diverted, however, from
my purpose, and must, in a future
number, resume the disquisition.</p>

<h2>THE AFRICAN PEOPLE.</h2>


<p>It does not appear that sufficient
consideration is given to the case of
those black people, who have been
rendered free by or under the laws
of the states and old provinces, from
the earliest period. We have established
in the city and county of Philadelphia,
in Pennsylvania, <em>a system
professing to be for the universal education
of the poor</em>, at the public expense,
to which the black people, by
the taxes upon their real property,
consumption taxes, and all the taxes
of the whites (except the little personal
or occupation tax,) actually
contribute. It cannot be denied, that
many of them are as truly among
the poor, as the most and least poor
of the white heads of families, whose
children are admitted to this <em>constitutional</em>
and legal provision. The
blacks also pay all the consumption
duties on imported foreign articles,
so far as they consume them.</p>

<p>We ought to consider the very low
state of the proper blacks in Africa,
where their uncivilized condition has
long been most unhappily made worse
by the neighbourhood of the four Saracen
or Moorish piratical States of
Barbary, devoted to military plunder,
the slavery of the whites and blacks,
and the imposter superstitions of
Mahomet, sacrilegiously pretending
to add himself to the Almighty in
the government of his church and his
earth. Besides these, the slave dealers
of the world have resorted to the
African ports and islands, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
combined with powerful, avaricious,
and inhuman princes and dealers, in
that country, to make out a course of
slave traffic with every nation, in
whose system of industry African
slaves are more profitable and efficient
than white labourers. From
the islands of Bourbon, Mauritius
and Madagascar, round by the Cape
of Good Hope and up to the Saracen
or Moorish kingdom of Morocco,
this system has long prevailed. It is
unhappily true, that the great collection
of proper Negro districts of Africa,
remain now in the darkest state of
irreligion, immorality and incivilization.
It is also true, that this is so
rooted in their system, that the actual
transfer, since the year 1620, of a
number of Africans to this country
now amounting, with their descendants,
to about one million and a half
of the unmixed and mixed breeds, is
to be considered as <em>a great and complicated
dispensation of Divine Providence</em>,
drawing that numerous people
into the bosom and body of an enlightened
nation, averse to the traffic,
from the date of the <em>first</em> act of
Virginia of 1778, <em>abolishing the slave
trade</em>, to the present consummation
of that prohibition, under the laws of
the Union. We have gone, <em>first</em> in
Pennsylvania, one step further by our
act of 1780, which, while it unhappily
recognized <em>the slavery of all the
living</em>, instead of emancipating three
or four thousand at the public expense,
or at the expense of the holders,
confined its operation to establishing
the freedom of those who should
be <em>thereafter</em> born of the slaves held
and continuing to be held among us.</p>

<p>In order, so far as in us lies, humbly
to justify and bless the dispensation
of Providence, which has drawn
these people out of the gloomy abyss
of the human family in the vast African
black-peopled district, stained as
it unhappily partially is even by the
awful cannibal practice, and by human
sacrifices, let us, of Pennsylvania,
who have been first to make
their native American <em>posterity</em> free,
be the most distinguished, <em>in justice
to their submissive and patient early
labours in forming our fair old province</em>,
in dispensing to them the benefits
of that religious, moral, scholastic
and professional education, without
which they cannot live in the good
hopes of this their earthly residence
or of the world beyond the grave.&mdash;It
is well understood, that our city
and county school system is not practically
and effectually extended to the
poor black people. An appeal is
respectfully made to the friends of
religion, morals, useful knowledge,
and general industry, whether we
ought not to dispense to them a more
generous, just and civilized freedom.
If we mean to avoid arguments
against the gradual and ultimate
abolition of slavery, let us endeavour
to instruct them in all those things,
which will enable them to labour with
advantage, to get their own living in
the progressive station on this continent,
to which it has pleased God to
suffer them to be transferred. To the
black people themselves, it is proper
to recommend a very modest and
good conduct in all things, without
which <em>they</em> cannot succeed, nor can
the endeavours of <em>their best friends</em>
be availing and effectual.</p>

<h3>ON GIMCRACKERY.</h3>


<p>The invention of new instruments
and machines is among the noblest
exertions of the human faculties. It
is said to be considered by some philosophers
as the most striking distinguishing
character between our
species and the brute creation, that
man is a <em>tool-making</em> animal. He is
certainly the only one who selects his
instruments with care and adapts
them to his purposes, by altering
their shape and structure. At any
rate, the temporal advantages which
we possess over the beasts, are universally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
perhaps, obtained through
this medium. As this is the case,
one might suppose that they who invent
and improve these engines of
superiority, would receive the homage
of their fellow men to their talents
and thanks for their benefit to
the human race. Why, then, what
is called Gimcrackery should fall into
disrepute, is an inquiry of some curiosity.</p>

<p>We cannot well deny the truth of
the very common remark, that inventors
are very apt to fail of realizing,
by their ingenuity, a solid provision
for life; nor can we well avoid concluding,
that of the many contrivances
daily offered to the public, that
the probability of any one becoming
permanently useful is very small indeed.
When we consider, however,
that the great mass of these inventions
are designed for the attainment
of wealth, and that such an amount
of skill and ingenuity are employed,
the above conclusions cannot fail to
appear singular. One would think
inventors could not, with these acknowledged
talents, well fail of at
least securing their own independence,
although their schemes may
not be profitable to others. If, however,
we analyse the motives by which
such persons are guided, we shall
find, I think, some explanation.</p>

<p>There are few if any men who are
not more or less influenced by a desire
of some species of fame or distinction,
although, in many of the
common situations of life, this does
not interfere with the pursuit of
wealth, and only shows itself in moments
of relaxation from the toils of
necessity. For one who wishes to
signalize himself in his trade or profession,
and who is swayed by that
desire as a ruling passion, there are
probably many who seek to gratify
their pride, by the pursuit of eminence
in other things. People aim
at distinction in conversational wit, in
politics, philosophy or even drinking
or gaming; while the hours devoted
to business are guided by the wish
for property alone, undisturbed by
the love of fame. In the persons of
whom we are speaking, this feeling,
inseparable from the nature of man,
has a powerful influence on their serious
business. They are not to get
wealth only, but distinction, by their
talents; and I question much whether
they are not more under the influence
of a wish for the latter than the former.
Praise is most generally, at
least in this instance, gained by a single
exertion, and by the study of a
short time. The invention once
made, and its applicability rendered
plausible, all further contemplation
of the subject is accompanied by an
exulting hope that fills and occupies
the mind. But applying either inventions
or any other means to the
common business of life, is a more
monotonous, common-place labour,
that affords no high and exhilarating
excitement to persevere. The consequence
too often is that the inventor
quits one hopeful scheme before it is
half reduced to practice, to fly to
something still more new; showing
by this that he is fonder of the act of
inventing than of making money by
the results. Of this preference of
fame to wealth, a striking instance is
often afforded by those illiterate persons
who follow this pursuit. These
often voluntarily abstain from studying
the scientific labours of their predecessors,
of which I have known instances,
in order to preserve the originality
of their projects, though frequently
at the expense of their perfection
and utility. If, then, the
larger portion of the labour of these
men is devoted to the attainment of
celebrity, they can hardly quarrel
with results of their own making, nor
expect fortune to come to their hands
unsought.</p>

<p>Persons who wish to acquire wealth,
or, in fact, to achieve any permanent
end, are generally obliged to use
steady perseverance, and to apply all
the talents they are masters of for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
length of time. Precisely the same
is the case with inventors. That inventor
meets with very extraordinary
success indeed, who is not obliged, in
the application of his plans to a useful
purpose, to employ prudence and
economy, and all those qualities which
enable a man to conduct business to
advantage and to influence the minds
of others. Hence it is that inventions
so often lie for a length of years, forgotten
or neglected, till some one of
less originality, but more perseverence,
influence and mercantile calculation,
carries them into effect with
advantage.</p>

<p>The want of being acquainted with
the efforts and discoveries of predecessors
is the cause of prodigious
waste of time and talent. Hence the
thousand schemes for perpetual motion,
and a variety of other attempts
scarce less extravagant, because made
with equal ignorance. And, in fact,
there is a strong tendency in having
acquired the knowledge of the labours
of others, to clip the wings of
invention, and render men of learning
much less apt to attempt novelties
than while they knew less.</p>

<p>Extravagance in pecuniary matters
is another frequent cause of the ruin
of ingenious artists and of those who
trust in them. This is shown, both
in imprudently investing considerable
sums of money without a reasonable
probability of a return, and in the general
lavish style in which such men
often live and experiment.</p>

<p>In fact, to turn inventions to advantage,
requires the singling out of one
good, feasible plan, mercantile prudence
in calculating probabilities, and
mercantile economy in the conduct
of the business, together with perseverence
enough to prevent marring
one scheme by prematurely beginning
another. These qualities are
so rarely found in combination with
mechanical originality, or, indeed
with that restless versatility which
keeps men on the search for its productions,
that it will perhaps always
continue to be generally the case;
that one man shall invent and persuade
another to make experimental
trials, but a third, and one totally unconnected
with either, if any one,
shall reap the increase.</p>

<h3>THE PRODUCTIONS OF THE EARTH.</h3>


<p>No subject can more deeply interest
the planters and farmers of this
country. Our merchants can export
every American production without
duty, tax or impediment. We have
all the benefits of a foreign, coasting,
and interior trade, free as to our own
laws, and the national government
are constantly engaged in negotiations
and regulations calculated to
soften or remove the inconveniences
of foreign monopolies in commerce
and navigation. Such measures are
pending now with Britain and France.</p>

<p>When trade has exhausted its power
to find a profitable market, abroad
or at home, the conversion of our unsaleable
surplus produce into new
forms, commonly denominated <em>domestic
manufactures</em>, becomes an object
of reasonable consideration. It
is well known, that the cultivated soil
and the bowels of the earth give us
the following principal objects as the
fruits of the culture of the land, or
as its spontaneous productions. 1,
Hemp; 2, Flax; 3, Wool; 4, Iron;
5, Silk; 6, Hides and Skins; 7, Sugar;
8, Indigo, Woad, Madder; 9,
Grass; 10, Grain; 11, Wood; 12,
Tobacco, and 13, Cotton. Such has
long been the unforced state of our
manufacturing industry, that in 1797,
in 1810, and in 1819, we did not export
any surplus or quantity, however
small, of the first eight of those valuable
productions. Our manufacturers,
without the war or double, or
present duties, bought at home and
worked up the whole. The returns
of exports prove, that we did not ship
any part of several of those articles,
and if we shipped a little of some,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
we imported a greater weight and
value of the same kinds of foreign
produce or raw materials.</p>

<p>Of the 9th article, Grass or Hay,
we shipped very little, screwed into
compact bundles for the West Indies.</p>

<p>Of the 10th, Grain, with some
Fruit and Molasses, we have a brewery
and distillery, a cider and general
liquor manufacture, equal to forty
millions of gallons, and requiring a
quantity of produce equal to the value
of sixteen millions of bushels of
grain, of which above seven-eighth
parts are drawn from our own lands.
This is equal to the value of seven
millions of barrels of flour, and we
did not ship to foreign countries, in
1819, more than 750,000 barrels. It
is plain, that the liquor manufactories
of the United States (to which we
are adding wine, worth to France
100,000,000 dollars,) are a very principal
support of our agriculture.&mdash;We
also make of grain, quantities of
starch, hair-powder, sizing, paste, ship
bread, wafers and vermicelli, hominy,
firmity, soft bread, pastry and other
preparations of grain. It is converted
into fatted cattle, hogs and poultry.
Ingenuity is and should be on
the stretch to employ and profitably
consume grain. Pork and beef maintain
better prices abroad than the
grain (or meal thereof,) with which
we feed cattle and hogs. The prohibition
of spirits, and the distillation of
molasses, in St. Domingo, will cut off
our supply of molasses.</p>

<p>Of the 11th article, Wood, we have
now one manufacture (our sea vessels,
coasters, river and other boats,) worth
40 or 50 millions of dollars. We
manufacture, for exportation, from
120 to 180 millions of staves, heading,
hoops, boards, scantling, plank,
and we have an immense cooperage
for foreign and domestic sale and use.
Besides buildings, fences, cabinet
ware, carriages, ploughs, harrows,
handspikes, turnery, boxes, cases, faggots,
cord-wood, &amp;c. &amp;c., to a vast
amount, profiting the owners and
clearers of wood lands.</p>

<p>12. Tobacco, of which we manufacture
nearly all we consume, and
fabricate as much for exportation,
probably, as we import in a manufactured
state for our consumption.
We could manufacture a quantity of
tobacco equal to the supply shipped
by all Europe.</p>

<p>Of Cotton, we are supposed to manufacture
30,000,000 of pounds, shipping
above three times that weight to
foreign countries. We yearly increase
in the goodness, fineness, utility,
variety and value of our cotton
manufactures. The looms of the
United States were, in A. D. 1810,
325,000, of which North Carolina
and Virginia, cotton and wool states,
had the most, being each nearly
41,000 looms. The water and steam
are well established, and work lower
than the cheapest hand looms of Europe
or Asia.</p>

<p>The plain instruction, of these genuine
facts, to our planters and farmers,
is, to encourage household manufactures,
and all other manufactures
on the estates, at the doors, in the
townships, villages, and counties in
which they live, consuming raw materials,
building materials, food for
man and beast, fuel, drinks, and other
productions of the earth. This system
of adjacent manufactures saves
all the cost of transportation of our
productions to the sea-ports, and the
expense of carrying foreign goods
from the sea-ports to the interior,
more profitable than canals and turnpike
roads.</p>

<p>Every judicious member of the
agricultural body must be a friend to
the freedom and encouragement of
our foreign commerce, as affording a
constant and sure market for a considerable
portion of the productions
of the earth. But, that manufactures
afford also a very great and sure
market for a larger variety, quantity
and value of our landed productions,
is no less manifest and certain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
The nail mill, the paper mill,
the screw mill, the brewery, the
spinning and weaving mills, the calico
printing mill, the pottery, and
many other works and arts to fabricate
useful necessary supplies out of
our raw materials, will (including all
our manufactures) be worth, in the
whole of 1820, more than five times
the value of our exported goods for
sale in foreign countries. Let every
farmer, planter, iron-master, &amp;c.,
therefore, encourage manufactures in
his household, on his estate, and in his
neighbourhood, as the surest method
of making a profitable home demand,
without the expense of transportation,
for the fruits of his labour, and the
natural productions of his forests,
mines and quarries. We purposely
avoid to urge forcing and protecting
duties, referring only to those existing,
which have been ordained principally
for the purpose of raising the requisite
public revenue. We do not interfere
in the agitation of the question
about protecting duties. We
believe the cheapness of produce and
labour and improved machinery and
labour-saving processes, will occasion
manufactures to prosper and increase,
and thus to support the growers of
produce and the owners of the land, beyond
even our free and valuable trade.
To this, the duties laid for revenue, for
defence, and for the encouragement
of agriculture, will materially contribute;
such as the impost upon East
India cotton goods, of 27<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> to 62<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> and
even 80 and 90 per cent., as made entirely
of foreign cotton, rival to our
cotton, flax, hemp, wool and silk.</p>

<h2>EXTRACTED FROM
THE MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS OF C. E.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><i>On the increase of the Domestic Sugar
of the United States.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>It would seem to be a great acquisition
to our country, if we could
produce from our own soil whatever
sugar might be necessary for our own
consumption, without having recourse
to foreign Islands or nations; it will
therefore be satisfactory, I apprehend,
to all lovers of their country to
find that we are already making rapid
advances, as will appear to any
person who attentively weighs the
following items of information, collected
at different times from our
public newspapers; from whence it
may be inferred, that before many
years have expired a supply sufficient
for our own use will be furnished
within our own territories.</p>

<p>1812, January 10&mdash;Albert Gallatin,
Esq. then Secretary of the Treasury,
informed the Committee of Ways and
Means, in a letter, that the Western
States were then entirely supplied
with salt of domestic produce; and
that they consumed annually seven
millions of pounds of sugar, made
from the Sugar Maple tree, which,
says he, is nearly all they use. Now,
if in 1812 the <em>Western</em> States produced
7,000,000 pounds of sugar from
such trees, it is probable that in 1820,
<em>they</em> would produce not less than
10,000,000 in a year. If to this we add
what is yielded in the states of Vermont,
New York, and Pennsylvania, it
seems likely that the whole amount
of such sugar, now made annually in
the United States, is not less than 15
millions of pounds.</p>

<p>By a publication in a late newspaper,
it appears that there were exported
from New Orleans, in six
months preceding 1st May, 1820,
15,652 hogsheads of sugar; all this
no doubt was of their own growth
and produced from the Sugar Cane.
I am informed by a dealer in sugar,
that the sugar hogsheads of New
Orleans do not average less than 1000
pounds to each hogshead, making, in
six months, 15,652,000 pounds, and
in the whole year probably 20,000,000
pounds; total of sugar from the Sugar
tree and Cane, 35,000,000 pounds
annually. This exhibits a very rapid
increase in the amount of sugar made,
as I think Secretary Gallatin, in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
older communication, not 20 years
ago, stated that New Orleans at that
time exported only about 2,000,000
of pounds of sugar.</p>

<p>The supply now furnished as above
will probably be greatly augmented
in future years, from the same
sources.</p>

<p>Add to these the prospect of sugar
to be raised or produced from the
Cane in Carolina and Georgia, as may
be collected from the following items,
selected from the newspapers also,
viz.</p>

<p>In 1814, Thomas Spalding made
on Sapelo Island, in lat. 31<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>, as much
as 95 hogsheads of excellent sugar,
equal to Jamaica, from Canes he had
planted there.</p>

<p>In 1815, Major Butler, on his plantation
in South Carolina, produced
by the labour of seventeen hands, off
of 85 acres of land, 140,000 pounds
of sugar, and 75 hogsheads of molasses.</p>

<p>Also, John M'Queen, off of 18
acres, had 20,000 Canes per acre,
worked by five or six hands; 5,000
Canes, the produce of one quarter of
an acre, yielded 600 gallons of juice,
which boiled down made 672 pounds
sugar, and may lose 50 pounds in
draining, leaving 622 pounds; or per
acre, of sugar, 2,488 pounds.</p>

<p>Again, as to the Sugar Maple tree,
or as some say it is more properly
styled, "The Sugar Tree;" in 1815,
64,000 pounds of sugar were made
in the town of Plattsburgh, Clinton
county, New York. In 1818, 22,000
pounds were made by 80 families, in
one township in Bradford county,
Pennsylvania, which is on an average
275 pounds to each family.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt but that
arrangements might be made by some
of the merchants of Philadelphia, to
procure a regular supply of the best
Sugar Tree sugar, for the accommodation
of such persons as are religiously
scrupulous of using sugar
made from the Cane, which is produced
by the labour of slaves.</p>

<p>I have seen Maple sugar with
which sufficient pains had been taken
in the making and draining, that was
as handsome in its appearance and as
well tasted and good in every respect,
I thought, as any West India sugar
I had ever seen, and when refined
equal to any loaf sugar. Of which,
I remember H. D. of this city, merchant,
since deceased, about the year
1789, sent some boxes as a present
to general Washington, then president
of the United States, residing in
New York.</p>

<p>Near twenty years ago, when little
domestic sugar was made in the United
States, I computed from the duties
paid, that the whole consumption
of sugar annually in our country,
then, was about ten pounds for every
individual, on an average. There
are now, I suppose, ten millions of
inhabitants in the United States, who,
at the above ratio, would consume
annually 100,000,000 pounds sugar,
of which we now make 35,000,000 lbs.
per annum, as above calculated.</p>

<p>Last winter there was an account in
some of the newspapers, that a person
in Virginia had obtained a patent
for making sugar from wheat, rye or
Indian corn; that it was good sugar,
and that each bushel yielded fifteen
pounds. I have heard no more of it,
but if well founded, this would be the
greatest acquisition of all, because,
in every part of our country, sugar,
without the use of slaves, could be
made in the greatest abundance, and
might beneficially supplant the practice
of making so much pernicious
whiskey, in places remote from sea-ports.</p>

<p>From what has been now stated,
there seems to be scarce room for a
doubt, but that in a few years, we can
be supplied from domestic sources
with all the sugar we shall want for
our own consumption.</p>

<p>By an account of Joseph Cooper's
native Grape Vine, published in your
Rural Magazine, No. 7, page 247
as little doubt can exist but that with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
proper care by the farmers, our country
may also be supplied with good
wine, sufficient for our own use, and
probably with more profit to the
growers, than they can find by pursuing
the old beaten track of adhering
almost entirely to grain which is
now so low in price.</p>

<p>The southern and western parts
of our territories would, probably,
with proper encouragement, yield all
the coffee and silk we might be able
to consume.</p>

<p>All these, and many other objects
of culture, are proper for the attention,
recommendation and encouragement
of state legislatures, of agricultural
societies, and of all patriotic
members of society. Thus we may
become, in time, really independent;
and from the extent of our country,
and the variety of its climates, come
to consider our own dominions as a
world of our own, producing nearly
all that is necessary for the use of
man, as Sir George Staunton, in his
Embassy, says the Chinese consider
their vast extensive empire. This
consideration, probably, makes them
in a great measure, regardless of foreign
trade.</p>

<h2>ENCOURAGEMENT FOR FARMERS
ON POOR LAND.</h2>


<p>It is believed, that many productions
possess a delicacy in their qualities,
when raised on light soils,
which they have not, when grown
on rich and fat soils. The wool produced
on the poor South Down soils
of Great Britain is far superior to the
wool raised on the rich alluvion lands
of Lincolnshire in that country. The
wines produced among the gravels
and pebbles of the <em>Medoc</em> district near
Bordeaux are much superior to the
wines produced on the <em>palus</em> or alluvion
lands between the two rivers
Lot and Garonne in the same vicinity.
The Tesamum produces the
most delicate oil from light soils.
This suggestion is worthy of consideration
and experiment in respect
to animals, fruits, grains, and gardeners
and farmers' vegetables.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are none of our natural
advantages which it still remains
for us fully to appreciate and avail
ourselves of, so much as those which
respect the agriculture of our country.</p>

<p>Without running into all the errors
of the economists or adopting their
entire theory, we trust that we may
assert the paramount importance of
this pursuit, particularly to the United
States. To every country it affords
at least a partial, and often a
complete subsistence for its population;
it gives a constant and healthful
employment to sometimes more
than half and never less than a fifth
of the community; its profits though
not so large, are more certain than
those in other employments of captal;
and while it replaces the annual advance
invested, a surplus profit has accrued,
which can be employed as private
interest and the public good may
require.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But in the United States
the cultivation of the soil has these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
and many more advantages; nay, it
is intimately connected with our national
character, because it powerfully
acts upon the morals and constitution
of our citizens. If it be
true, that the torch of liberty has
always burned with a purer and
brighter lustre on the mountains than
on the plains, it is still more true,
that the sentiments of honour and
integrity more generally animate the
rough but manly form of the farmer,
than the debilitated body of the artisan.
There is in that primitive and
honourable occupation, the culture
of the earth, something which, while
it pours into the lap of the state an
increase beyond every other employment,
gives us more than the fabled
stone, not only a subsistence,
but a placid feeling of contentment;
not only creates the appetite to enjoy,
but guarantees its continuance
by a robust constitution, fortified with
the safeguards of temperance and
virtue.</p>

<p>The anxiety of our countrymen
to possess in fee a spot of ground
however small, and the consequent
paucity of leases, is a fact no less
curious than it is solitary. This is
not the case, or at least in any considerable
degree, in any other country.
Such indeed in Britain were
formerly those small proprietors called
franklins, who possessed a keen
spirit of independence and a determined
opposition to oppression; feelings
which, with the alienation of
their farms, have gradually departed
from the breasts of their descendants.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, however, the ease
with which the pride of independent
possession may be gratified, it is not
the less true that agriculture, instead
of being a favoured, has been a degraded
and unpopular pursuit; that
instead of cherishing every motive
which might lead to its honourable
extension, we have endeavoured gradually
to weaken its legitimate efforts.
It is indeed a singular inquiry,
why the cultivation of the soil
among us should have been so little
encouraged, when every state in
Europe, since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
has turned its most assiduous
attention to this most important
department of domestic economy,
and ultimately borrowed from
it the resources which have carried
them through the prodigious conflicts
of the last generation.</p>

<p>There have been many causes,
certainly not all of equal efficacy,
which have co-operated against the
interests of agriculture. But there
is a prominent one to which we can
but just allude. During a very considerable
period, since the peace of
'83, the peculiar situation of Europe
has afforded opportunities for commercial
enterprise too tempting to
be resisted.&mdash;American merchants
received, in the lapse of a very few
years, the most astonishing accessions
of wealth; and fortunes, ordinarily
the fruit of a laborious life, and never
the portion of many, were amassed
with unparalleled rapidity, and by
large numbers. Our domestic prosperity
more than equalled the extension
of our trade. It was then that
the compting-houses of our merchants
were filled with youth from the
country, who forsook the slower but
surer emoluments of agriculture, for
the mushroom but unsubstantial fortunes
of commerce; nay, who preferred
the meanest drudgery behind
the counter of a retail dealer, to the
manly and invigorating toil of the
cultivator of his paternal acres. Unfortunately
this spirit of migration was
encouraged by too great a success in
trade. Feelings of vulgar pride contracted
in town caused the manual
labour of the farmer to be regarded
as degrading; this unworthy sentiment
spread with baleful influence,
and when the compting-houses became
overstocked and afforded no
longer a resource, it was no uncommon
thing to see a young man with
no qualifications but a little bad Latin
picked up at a miserable village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
school, forsake a large and fertile
farm and apprentice himself to a poor
country attorney.</p>

<p>Another cause of the depressed
state of agriculture, mentioned in
late publication,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is the constant emigration
to the west. There must necessarily
be a tendency to a most empoverishing
system of cultivation,
where people feel that after having
extracted all the richness of the soil,
they may throw it up and remove
to a country, which offers them an
untouched surface, and needs no artificial
aid of composts or manure.
The land, besides suffering from negligence
consequent on the prospect
of departure, will be worn out by successive
crops, and long be rendered
unfit for the most valuable dispositions
of the agriculturist. Indeed
we have been informed, that in many
instances, when the land is almost
ruined by the continued culture of
tobacco, it is sold by the planter to
some enterprizing and laborious individual,
who may restore it by his
patience and attention, while he himself
removes to another spot, where
the same wretched system of exhaustion
may again be renewed.&mdash;There
are other causes we might
mention, such as the unwieldy size
of our farms, and particularly the
want of a regular enlightened farming
system. But we cannot now stop
to enter on these topics, but may notice
them hereafter.</p>

<p>If then agriculture be so important
an item in a nation's resources, affording
such subsistence to its population,
and a surplus capital to be
employed in the various objects of
national industry and enterprise, it
would seem to follow, that nothing
but very imperious circumstances
should induce any government to repress
its vigour, or palsy the exertions
of those devoted to it. Immediately
connected with such an attempt
was the late bill before Congress,
establishing a new tariff of
duties. But why go back to a bill
which was rejected? We answer,
that it is not to be forgotten that
private interest is one of the most
powerful incentives to action, that
the manufacturing interest is large
and increasing, that one defeat will
not discourage its partisans, and lastly,
extraordinary as the fact may seem,
that the bill in question, fraught with
such varied evil, was thrown out by
a majority of only <em>one</em> vote in the senate.
The tendency of this project
was not only to introduce an unequal
system of taxation, but first, by the
destruction of a large part of our foreign
commerce, to diminish very
materially the market for our home
products, and secondly, to divert a
large portion of agricultural industry
into the service of the loom and
spinning jenny.</p>

<p>But it will be asked, are manufactures
then to be entirely neglected?
Most certainly not. Still there
is a certain limit, in a newly settled
country with a thin population, beyond
which their establishment is not
only useless to government, but a
burden to the people. It is undoubtedly
true that the manufacture of articles
of immediate necessity or very
general circulation ought to be encouraged
by a wise and provident
people; but it ordinarily happens
that these need no extraordinary patronage;
their extended use soon
gives a facility to the artist, which
enables him to enter into competition
with the foreigner, provided the raw
material is to be found at home in
any tolerable abundance. Thus we
find that hats were manufactured in
the colonies at a very early period;
together with household furniture,
saddlery, &amp;c. they have long since
ceased to be an article of importation.
It is necessary for the well-being
and security of a nation, that certain
articles, should be manufactured
within its limits, such as gunpowder,
coarse clothing, and some others of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
similar discription.&mdash;But the moment
people attempt to force by means
of high duties on foreign imports the
production of a commodity, which,
by reason of the extravagance of
the wages of labour and other causes,
must necessarily be sold at a much
greater price than the imported one,
their conduct would seem no less
an affront to common sense, than a
solecism in political economy.</p>

<p>The United States possess a very
restricted capital; and as the tilling
of the soil requires comparatively
much fewer advances than any
other department of industry, that
capital became immediately invested
in agriculture. Land, cheap, and fertile,
constituted a fund which gave
a certain profit. And as the productions
of the labour of more than
five eighths of our population went
to purchase foreign articles either of
luxury or necessity, a great and profitable
intercourse was constantly
maintained with Europe. Under an
equitable system of foreign duties,
arising from this commerce, the expenses
of government were defrayed,
our debt gradually extinguished, and
by a powerful but necessary re-action
our agriculture improved and extended.
But the tariff bill restricted a
large and valuable commerce principally
with Britain. It is not to be
supposed that, while we refused the
broadcloths and hardware of England,
she would still continue to buy
the same proportion of our cotton
and tobacco. Our market then for
these articles would be so far lost;
and if we now feel the effects of a
diminished demand for our produce
in consequence of the establishment
of peace in Europe, how can it be
thought a wise policy to suffer other
embarrassments and losses, by excluding
ourselves entirely from every
foreign port where we might calculate
upon its sale? Where then is
our produce to find a vent? For assuredly
the most enthusiastic friend
of domestic manufactures could never
imagine, that the most extensive
establishment of them could ever
give an adequate consumption for
the present amount of our agricultural
productions.</p>

<p>The bill then imposing heavy duties
on foreign articles, besides diminishing
the number of the cultivators
of the soil, would in some degree
operate as a tax on its fruits,
because, while the price of manufactures
was enormously increased,
the value of produce would be more
than proportionally diminished. For
the cultivator, not only deprived of
the benefit of a competition between
the domestic and foreign consumer
in the sale of his articles, is obliged
to purchase those of his neighbour,
at any price which his cupidity and
the tariff may determine. The expenses
of the state being still the
same and its usual resources dried
up, a general but unequal system of
taxation would be adopted, which in
fact, the farmer bending under the
weight of this partial policy, is less
able to pay whatever contribution
may be levied. These assertions are
by no means novel, they are mere
corollaries from the plainest and most
undoubted principles of political economy.
Dr. Adam Smith, the great
father of the science, and all whose
views on this subject, though not
acted upon in a country whose domestic
policy was too firmly established
to be changed without a most
serious revolution, ought to have great
weight with us in the adoption of
any permanent system, speaks in this
decided manner in his "Wealth of
Nations," vol. iii. p. 201. "It is thus
that every system which endeavours,
either by extraordinary encouragements,
to draw towards a particular
species of industry a greater share of
the capital of the society, than what
would naturally go to it; or by extraordinary
restraints, to force from
particular species of industry some
share of the capital which would
otherwise be employed in it; is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
reality subversive of the great purpose
which it means to promote. It
retards instead of accelerating the
progress of the society towards real
wealth and greatness; and diminishes
instead of increasing the real value
of the annual produce of its land and
labour. All systems either of preference
or restraint therefore, being
thus completely taken away, the obvious
and simple system of natural liberty
establishes itself of its own accord.
Every man, as long as he does
not violate the laws of justice, is left
perfectly free to pursue his own interest
his own way, and to bring both
his industry and capital into competition
with those of any other man or
order of men." M. Say, a man no
less remarkable for his practical
knowledge of manufacturing industry,
than his profound acquaintance
with every branch of economical
science, has given his marked disapprobation
of that system which we
are discussing. "Lorsqu'au travers
de cette marche naturelle des choses,"
says he, "l'autorité se montre et dit:
le produit, qu'on veut créer, celui
qui donne les meilleurs profits, et
par conséquent celui qui est le plus
recherché, n'est pas celui qui convient,
il faut qu'on s'occupe de tel
autre; elle dirige évidemment une
partie de la production vers un genre,
dont le besoin se fait sentir davantage."
Traité d'Economic Politique,
tom. i. p. 168. We can only refer
to pages 172 and 201 for the expansion
of these ideas. It is thus we
find that the arguments adduced in
favour of this system neither accord
with the convictions of fact nor the
suggestions of reason. Whenever
the increasing capital devoted to the
land can no longer be profitably employed,
then manufactures will flourish
and the surplus profits of agriculture
be legitimately devoted to
their support.</p>

<p>During the late war, the prospect
of large gains caused by the extravagant
price of all European commodities,
caused many persons in our
country to embark their fortunes in
cotton and woollen factories.&mdash;These
factories were brought into being by
a temporary and unnatural state of
things. On the return of the peace
of 1814, many of these manufacturing
establishments came of necessity
to an end. Some establishments
remain and ought to succeed, because
they prove that the profits of
their capital may enter into competition
with that employed in agriculture.
In this case the transfer
is not only natural but conducive to
national wealth.</p>

<p>But we are asked to patronise manufactures
at the expense of agriculture,
on the ground of our being
rendered really more independent by
them. This is, however, but an attempt
to conceal private interest under
the garb of patriotism,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and
ought at least to awaken suspicion.
We are not to be called <em>dependant</em>
merely because a state of war might
give rise to many inconveniences. We
can do without silks or broadcloths
while we possess the real means of
sustenance and defence. But these
factories once established, say the
advocates of this interest, the citizens
ought to support them in their present
languishing condition, and therefore
ought not to buy, even at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
much less price, foreign articles in
preference to our own. The force
and propriety of such reasoning would
appear to be similar to that of a gardener,
who having in winter devoted
himself to the cultivation of flowers,
&amp;c., by means of artificial heat,
should in the spring apply for an
act of the municipal authority, forbidding
all persons to pluck a daisy or
violet in the field, and requiring them
to resort to his hot-house. So far
from there being a necessity for any
interference on the part of government,
we believe we may assert that
our manufactures never were so flourishing
as since the peace. It is true
that many establishments have been
broken up and much capital sunk,
but it is a fact that those factories
which are in the hands of individuals,
have generally been successful,
while those conducted by incorporated
companies wanting the circumspection
and prudence of private interest,
have as often become bankrupt.
In the western states this
branch of business has greatly improved,
and recent information enables
us to affirm, that the profits
which are now realised are nearly as
large as those during the war. In
the east, we might cite an instance,
which must put down all cavil on
this subject. The cotton factory at
Waltham near Boston, begun when
manufactures were by no means in so
promising a situation as at present,
is a triumphant answer to every one
who demands additional encouragement
for the loom, and a new tax on
his brethren to extend its operations.</p>

<p>But we hasten to return from our
wanderings, and to introduce our
readers to the work, of which we
have prefixed the title to this article.
It is in the form of letters addressed
to Professor Pictet of Geneva, from
various places in Italy, and contains the
author's remarks upon that country.
He dwells not on the palaces of Venice,
neither worships at the altar of
Roman genius in the Pantheon, but
taking his silent way through the
fields, he describes that which gave
birth to both: he informs us of the
processes of Italian farming, of the
effects of irrigation, and of the general
state of Italian agriculture. And,
in our opinion, he has shewn as much
taste in the execution of his design,
as those travellers who have employed
themselves upon inquiries commonly
thought as interesting, but
certainly not as useful. M. de Chateauvieux
appears to be an enthusiastic
admirer of the subject on which
he writes, as well as to have a practical
knowledge of all its details. His
book is very little known among us,
though it has lately been translated
in England, and formerly occupied
the attention of a celebrated critical
journal of that country. It is our intention
in this article to put our readers
in mind of its existence.</p>

<p>The author divides Italy into three
regions, distinguished by their different
systems of cultivation.&mdash;The first
extends from mount Cenis and the
Alps of Suza to the shores of the
Adriatic. The fertility of Lombardy
is proved by the constant succession
of its crops, and to this province he
has given the name of "Pays de Culture
par assolement," or the district
of culture by rotation of crops. The
second of the regions reposes on the
southern declivity of the Appenines,
from the frontiers of Provence to the
boundaries of Calabria. This is called
the District of Olive trees, or, by
an association somewhat forced, of
Canaanitish culture. The third region
is that of <i>Malaria</i>, or patriarchal
cultivation, from a supposed resemblance,
which we are still less
able to enter into, between the shepherds
of the older and the present
time. It is found from Pisa to Terracina,
and comprehends the plain
between the sea and the first ridge of
the Appenines.</p>

<p>Lombardy has been often called
the garden of Europe, and seems
abundantly entitled to the appellation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
The soil is not only rich and
alluvial, but deep and perfectly level.
The climate is humid, and the
system of irrigation supplies water
to almost every field. These circumstances,
united to the heat of a
southern sun, cause a most rapid and
luxurious vegetation. Nothing can
be more important in the economy
of a farm than the situation of the
farm-house and its out-buildings. In
this respect our American farmers
are lamentably deficient, and though
we would not recommend as a model
the one described by de Chateauvieux
as common in Lombardy,
still we think it would afford some
valuable hints. The buildings raised
on the four sides of a square, present
on one side a central elevation of
two stories. The lower part for the
farmer, the upper story for his grain.
Adjoining this, at each end, is a
stable plastered so as not to let the
dust descend, for the cows and oxen;
the other three sides of the square
are enclosed by a sort of portico,
open within and supported by columns,
which serves as a depository
for straw, hay, &amp;c.&mdash;This structure
is about twenty-four feet broad, and
fifteen high. Half the court is paved,
the remainder is used for threshing
out the corn, which, in the primitive
way, is still done by horses. The
place for manure is outside of the
court. This plan presents the most
space with the least building, and
assures the preservation of every product.</p>

<p>The farms in Lombardy are small,
and do not often contain sixty arpents;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
notwithstanding M. de Chateauvieux
asserts against Arthur
Young, that they bring more to market
than the large farms, and that
there is no country in the world
which can dispose of so large a portion
of its productions as Piedmont.
If the fact be so, it may possibly arise
from the peculiar character of the
persons who cultivate the land.&mdash;Our
author, however, remarks, that
this system of small farms can never
take place till the advances of capital
have carried agriculture to its
highest point. Lombardy is cultivated
by a species of farmers, called
<em>metayers</em>. They pay a small fixed
rent, valued at one half the produce
of the meadow, or forty francs the
arpent. The clover belongs to them
entirely; the crops of wheat, Indian
corn, and flax, and the wine and
silk are equally divided between
them and their landlord. The latter
advances nothing but the taxes,
and of course must find such an arrangement
singularly advantageous.
Father and son continue the same
engagement, without the formality of
a lease or any registry of the contract.
M. Say regards this system as unfavourable
to agriculture, and in his
treatise on Political Economy, book
ii. chap. 9, vol. 2, says, "il y a des
cultivateurs qui n'ont rien, et auxquels
le propriétaire fournit le capital
avec la terre: on les appelle des
Métayers. Ils rendent communément
au propriétaire la moitié du
produit brut. Ce genre de culture
appartient à un état peu avancé de
l'agriculture, et il est le plus défavorable
de tout aux améliorations
des terres; car celui des deux, du
proprietaire ou du fermier, qui ferait
l'améliarition à ses frais, admettrait
l'autre à jouir gratuitement de la moitié
de l'interêt de ses avances."</p>

<h2>POTATOES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Southwick</span>,</p>

<p>I have stated in my former communications,
the result of my experience
in the cultivation of potatoes.
So long as I practised setting my crop
with small potatoes, the cullings of
my potato bins, my crops degenerated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
grew less and less for several
years, and finally run entirely out.&mdash;I
changed my practice, and the result
has been a continued improvement
for near ten years, both in quantity
and quality. My practice has been
to select the largest, soundest, and
best potatoes for seed, to cut them
into 4 quarters, and plant 4 pieces
in each hill in a square of about 9
inches. The results have been every
way satisfactory. My potatoes have
been large, constantly improving in
size, earlier, better, and more abundant
from year to year. I have never
been nice enough to weigh my seed,
to ascertain exactly whether a potato
of one ounce or two ounces be as perfect
a root as one of 6 or 12 ounces.
My experience both in planting and in
distillation has left on my mind a
strong impression that small unripe
seed is very improper, and very unprofitable.
I am aware that many
farmers hold firmly that small seed
potatoes are as good as large ones;
but I also know that I have sold potatoes
to these men at 5 and 6 shillings
per bushel, and some of them
have been convinced that good seed
was an object even at those prices.
In the south I am aware that it is
the practice almost uniformly to plant
small sweet potatoes. But I am fully
persuaded it is an error. To this
cause I think may be justly attributed
the decrease and deterioration in
the crops of this valuable root.</p>

<h2>ECONOMY IN FUEL.</h2>


<p>While economy is the order of the
day, it may not be amiss to point out
an item of which it is believed a general
ignorance prevails. It is well
known to philosophers that when water
commences to boil in the open
air no additional fire can make it any
hotter. A contrary opinion prevails,
and those employed in cooking victuals,
in order to accelerate the operation
think that they cannot make
the fire too intense. The fuel added
for this purpose is, in fact, not only
a wanton waste, but by causing a violent
ebulition, it forces from the victuals,
with the steam its finest flavour.
How much fuel in families might be
saved if, in cooking, no more were
used than to keep the water that is
used just at the boiling point, and it
is certain the victuals would be the
better for it.</p>

<h2>MAKING CIDER.</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>Directions for making sweet, clear Cider, that shall
retain its fine vinous flavour, and keep good for a
long time in casks, like wine.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is of importance in making cider,
that the mill, the press, and all the
materials be sweet and clean, and the
straw clear from must. To make
good cider, fruit should be ripe, (but
not rotten) and when the apples are
ground, if the juice is left in the pummice
twenty-four hours, the cider will
be richer, softer, and higher coloured;
if fruit is all of the same kind, it
is generally thought that the cider will
be better; as the fermentation will
certainly be more regular, which is
of importance. The gathering and
grinding of the apples, the pressing
out of the juice, is a mere manual labour,
performed with very little skill
in the operation; but here the great
art of making good cider commences;
for as soon as the juice is pressed out,
nature begins to work a wonderful
change in it. The juice of fruit, if left
to itself, will undergo three distinct
fermentations, all of which change the
quality and nature of this fluid. The
first is the vinous; the second the acid,
which makes it hard and prepares it
for vinegar; by the third it becomes
putrid. The first fermentation is the
only one the juice of apples should
undergo, to make good cider. It is
this operation that separates the juice
from the filth, and leaves it a clear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
sweet, vinous liquor. To preserve it
in this state is the grand secret; this
is done by fumigating it with sulphur,
which checks any further fermentation,
and preserves it in its fine vinous
state. It is to be wished that all cider
makers would make a trial of this method;
it is attended with no expense,
and but little trouble, and will have
the desired effect.</p>

<p>I would recommend that the juice
as it comes from the press, be placed
in open headed casks or vats: in this
situation it is most likely to undergo
a proper fermentation, and the person
attending may with correctness ascertain
when this fermentation ceases;
this is of great importance, and must
be particularly attended to. The fermentation
is attended with a hissing
noise, bubbles rising to the surface
and there forming a soft spongy crust
over the liquor. When this crust begins
to crack, and white froth appears
in the cracks level with the surface of
the head, the fermentation is about
stopping. At this time the liquor is
in a fine, genuine, clear state, and
must be drawn off immediately into
clean casks: and this is the time to
fumigate it with sulphur. To do this,
take a strip of canvas or rag, about 2
inches broad and twelve long; dip
this into melted sulphur, and when a
few pails of worked cider are put into
the cask, set this match on fire and
hold it in the cask, till it is consumed,
then bung the cask and shake it, that
the liquor may incorporate with and
retain the fumes; after this fill the
cask and bung it up. The cider
should be racked off again the latter
part of February or first of March;
and if not as clear as you wish it, put
in isinglass to fine it, and stir it well;
then put the cask in a cool place,
where it will not be disturbed, for the
fining to settle. Cider prepared in
this manner will keep sweet for years.</p>

<p>It is certainly of great importance
to the people of America to cultivate
the fruit that is natural to the soil of
their country, and to make the most
of the fruit which the soil produces;
especially, when its produce is an article
of value and of great consumption
in this country.</p>

<h2>CABBAGES FOR CATTLE.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Extract of a Letter.</i></p>


<p>Having been in England, I have had
an opportunity of observing many improvements
in agriculture, which, if
I were to see them adopted here,
would give me the sincerest pleasure.
Among the number of them, I think
the culture of cabbages for fattening
of cattle stands in the first rank. From
strong soils, it may fairly be questioned
whether any kind of winter provision
can be raised of such weight and
quality per acre, as the larger kind of
cabbages. For cows, they surpass all
other kinds of vegetables, and probably
some method may be thought of,
by which they may be conveniently
preserved through our long winters.
The colewort cabbage used to be in
most esteem, but I understand that a
variety of the large red kind is coming
into use, and bids fair to drive out the
Scotch drumhead, it being much
more hardy. They are exceedingly
well adapted to wet land, and will
prove very productive where turnips
cannot be raised to any good purpose.
It is, unquestionably, a crop of far
more use and value than the mangel
wurzel, which has, in England, within
these few years, been in such fashionable
culture.</p>

<p>In England and Scotland, I have
seen the <em>parings of potatoes</em> planted
as seed; and at the same time I was
told that they yielded quite as plentifully
as cuttings with three eyes, or
even whole potatoes.</p>

<p>I never had an opportunity of witnessing
the result, but it may be worth
while for some experimental agriculturist
to plant some in this way, in
order to prove or shew the fallacy of
the assertion. I should recommend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
that they cut the parings about two-tenths
of an inch in thickness, as those
parings which I saw planted always
had the eye left in them entire, and
the root of the germ not in the least
wounded.</p>

<h2>PRESENT STATE OF POMPEII.</h2>

<p class="center">From William's Travels in Italy, Greece, &amp;c.</p>


<p>Pompeii, which was entombed in a
softer substance, is getting daily disencumbered,
and a very considerable
part of this Grecian city is unveiled.
We entered by the Appian way,
through a narrow street of marble
tombs, beautifully executed, with the
names of the deceased plain and legible.
We looked into the columbary
below that of Marius Arius Diomedes,
and perceived jars containing the ashes
of the dead, with a small lamp at the
side of each. Arriving at the gate,
we perceived a sentry box in which
the skeleton of a soldier was found
with a lamp in its hand: proceeding
up the street beyond the gate, we went
into several streets, and entered what
is called a coffee house, the marks
of cups being visible on the stone; we
came likewise to a tavern, and found
the sign (not a very decent one) near
the entrance. The streets are lined
with public buildings and private
houses, most of which have their original
painted decorations fresh and
entire. The pavement of the streets
is much worn by carriage wheels, and
holes are cut through the side stones,
for the purpose of fastening animals
in the market place; and in certain
situations are placed stepping stones,
which give us rather unfavourable
ideas of the state of the streets. We
passed two beautiful little temples;
went into a surgeon's house, in the
operation room of which chirurgical
instruments were found; entered an
ironmonger's shop, where an anvil
and hammer were discovered; a
sculptor's and a baker's shop, in the
latter of which may be seen an oven
and grinding mills, like old Scotch
querns. We examined likewise an
oilman's shop, and a wine shop lately
opened, where money was found in
the till; a school in which was a small
pulpit with steps up to it, in the middle
of the apartment; a great theatre;
a temple of justice; an amphitheatre,
about 220 feet in length; various
temples; a barrack for soldiers,
the columns of which are scribbled
with their names and jests; wells,
cisterns, seats, tricliniums, beautiful
Mosaic; altars, inscriptions, fragments
of statues, and many other
curious remains of antiquity. Among
the most remarkable objects were
an ancient wall, with a part of a still
more ancient marble freze built in it
as a common stone; and a stream
which has flowed under this once subterraneous
city, long before its burial;
pipes of Terra Cotta to convey the
water to the different streets; stocks
for prisoners, in one of which a skeleton
was found. All these things
incline one almost to look for the
inhabitants, and wonder at the desolate
silence of the place.</p>

<p>The houses in general are very low,
and the rooms are small, I should
think not above ten feet high. Every
house is provided with a well and a
cistern. Every thing seems to be in
proportion; the principal streets do
not appear to exceed 16 feet in width,
with side pavements of about three
feet; some of the subordinate streets
are from 6 to 10 feet wide, with side
pavements in proportion; these are
occasionally high, and are reached by
steps. The columns of the barracks
are about 15 feet in height; they are
made of tuffa with stucco; one third
of the shaft is smoothly plastered, the
rest fluted to the capital. The walls
of the houses are often painted red,
and some of them have borders and
antique ornaments, masks, and imitations
of marbles, but in general poorly
executed. I have observed, on the
walls of an eating room, various kinds
of food and game tolerably represented;
one <em>woman's</em> apartment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
adorned with subjects relative to love;
and a <em>man's</em> with pictures of a martial
character. Considering that the whole
has been under ground upwards of
seventeen centuries, it is certainly
surprizing that they should be as fresh
as at the period of their burial. The
whole extent of the city, not half of
which is excavated, may be about four
miles. It is said that Murat employed
no less than 2000 men in clearing
Pompeii, and that Madame Murat
attended the excavations in person
every week. The present government
have not retained above 100.</p>

<p>After visiting this extraordinary
place, which certainly is the most interesting
of all the wonders of Naples,
we examined the museum of antiquities
at Purtici. The collections of
ancient paintings are curious and instructing,
some of them containing
exquisite pieces of art; one room is
filled with representations of fruit and
flowers, well painted and freely handled;
some grapes in particular are
remarkable for execution, quite transparent,
with the touches of light on
them judiciously placed to give effect
and clearness. A second room contains
various ornaments painted in a
masterly manner, and with considerable
ingenuity in the design. A third
is covered with various animals and
birds. Another apartment is filled
with landscapes, but these are all extremely
bad, having no perspective,
nor any truth of colouring: indeed it
would seem that the ancient painters
had never given their mind to that delightful
branch of the art. One landscape,
however, with all its faults, interested
me greatly, and that was a
view of ancient Puteoli, (now Pozzuolo,)
about six miles from Naples,
supposed to have been painted before
St. Paul landed there. The picture
is, of course, very different from the
present state of the city, but still a
likeness may be traced, if we keep in
view the site of the various temples
and other objects, the foundations of
which are still visible.</p>

<p>Among the innumerable pictures
which are crowded in several rooms,
I shall mention the following, which,
on slight examination, appeared to be
among the best: <i>Sophonisba drinking
the juice of Hemlock</i>, admirable in expression;
<i>an Infant Hercules strangling
Serpents</i>; <i>Jove</i>; <i>Leda and the
Swan</i>; <i>the Graces</i>; <i>a Venus</i>; <i>Education
of Bacchus</i>; <i>a Medusa's Head</i>:&mdash;these
are all slight, but it is that
slightness which conveys character
and refinement of taste; a <i>Theseus</i>
as large as life, in a fine attitude and
good expression: Two allegorical figures,
representing the river <i>Nile
and Egypt</i>; <i>the Education of Achilles</i>;
<i>a beautiful Female suckling an
aged Man</i>, (corresponding to the
Roman Charity,) most delicately expressed:
An <i>Academy of Music</i>, the
figures small, exquisitely painted;
harps and flageolets are the only instruments.
Among the curious pictures
is the interior of a school, in
which the master is represented flogging
a boy, who is upon another boy's
back; so that the practice of <em>horsing</em>
is sanctioned by very ancient authority.
Our attention was likewise attracted
by a shoemaker's and a cook's
shop; these last are but indifferently
designed and painted; a Wilkie or an
Allan would smile at such productions.
All these are in fresco, on
stucco grounds, and with a considerable
polish on the surface. It does
not seem that any glazing colours
have been used, the effect being produced
entirely by body colour. The
ancients, however, as Pliny informs
us, had a dark, yet transparent mixture,
which they laid over their highly
finished works, to give the delusion
required. From the freshness and
clearness of the colouring, they seem
to have had the advantage of painting
in oil, so far, at least, as durability is
of advantage.</p>

<p>The museum at Portici likewise
contains many statues and busts of
considerable merit; besides a great
variety of culinary articles, and specimens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of calcined barley, beans, paste
for bread, part of a roll, mustard-seed,
straw, rye, pine tops, figs, cloth like
tinder, fish nets, with corks attached
to them, spunge, soap, rings, earrings,
combs, thimbles, looking-glasses
of polished metal, and a variety of
emblems of luxury and taste, admirably
executed. We examined them
all with the keenest interest, though
the impression would have been more
gratifying, had they been left in the
ancient towns in which they were discovered.</p>

<h2>WASTE OF LIFE.</h2>

<p class="center">BY. DR. FRANKLIN.</p>


<p>Anergus was a gentleman of a
good estate, he was bred to no business,
and could not contrive how to
waste his hours agreeably; he had no
relish for any of the proper works of
life, nor any taste at all for the improvements
of the mind; he spent
generally ten hours of the four and
twenty in bed; he dozed away two
or three more on his couch, and as
many were dissolved in good liquor
every evening, if he met with company
of his own humour. Five or six
of the rest he sauntered away with
much indolence: the chief business
of them was to contrive his meals,
and to feed his fancy beforehand, with
the promise of a dinner and supper;
not that he was so very a glutton, or
so entirely devoted to appetite; but
chiefly because he knew not how to
employ his thoughts better, he let
them rove about the sustenance of
his body. Thus he had made a shift
to wear off ten years since the paternal
estate fell into his hands: and yet,
according to the abuse of words in
our day, he was called a man of virtue,
because he was scarce ever
known to be quite drunk, nor was his
nature much inclined to lewdness.</p>

<p>One evening, as he was musing
alone, his thoughts happened to take
a most unusual turn, for they cast a
glance backward, and began to reflect
on his manner of life. He bethought
himself what a number of living beings
had been made a sacrifice to support
his carcase, and how much corn
and wine had been mingled with those
offerings. He had not quite lost all
the arithmetic that he learned when
he was a boy, and he set himself to
compute what he had devoured since
he came to the age of man.</p>

<p>"About a dozen feathered creatures,
small and great, have one week
with another (said he) given up their
lives to prolong mine, which in ten
years amounts to at least six thousand.</p>

<p>"Fifty sheep have been sacrificed
in a year, with half a hecatomb of
black cattle, that I might have the
choicest part offered weekly upon
my table. Thus a thousand beasts
out of the flock and the herd have
been slain in ten years' time to feed
me, besides what the forest has supplied
me with. Many hundreds of
fishes have, in all their varieties, been
robbed of life for my repast, and of
the smaller fry as many thousands.</p>

<p>"A measure of corn would hardly
afford fine flour enough for a month's
provision, and this arises to above six
score bushels; and many hogsheads
of ale and wine, and other liquors,
have passed through this body of
mine, this wretched strainer of meat
and drink.</p>

<p>"And what have I done all this
time for God or <em>man</em>? What a vast
profusion of good things upon a useless
life, and a worthless liver! There
is not the meanest creature among all
these which I have devoured, but
hath answered the end of its creation
better than I. It was made to support
human nature, and it hath done
so. Every crab and oyster I have
eat, and every grain of corn I have
devoured, hath filled up its place in
the rank of beings with more propriety
and honour than I have done: O
shameful waste of life and time!"</p>

<p>In short, he carried on his moral
reflections with so just and severe a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
force of reason, as constrained him to
change his whole course of life, to
break off his follies at once, and to apply
himself to gain some useful
knowledge, when he was more than
thirty years of age; he lived many
following years with the character of
a worthy man, and an excellent Christian;
he performed the kind offices
of a good neighbour at home, and
made a shining figure as a patriot in
the senate-house; he died with a
peaceful conscience, and the tears of
his country were dropped upon his
tomb.</p>

<p>The world, that knew the whole
series of his life, stood amazed at the
mighty change. They beheld him
as a wonder of reformation, while he
himself confessed and adored the divine
power and mercy, which had
transformed him from a brute to a
man.</p>

<p>But this was a single instance; and
we may almost venture to write <span class="smcap">MIRACLE</span>
upon it. Are there not numbers
of both sexes among our young
gentry, in this degenerate age, whose
lives thus run to utter waste, without
the least tendency to usefulness!</p>

<p>When I meet with persons of such
a worthless character as this, it brings
to my mind some scraps of Horace,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2>LESSONS ON THRIFT.</h2>

<p class="center">Published for general benefit, by a Member
of the Save-all Club.</p>


<p>The caprice of men at different
periods has delighted to make much
of some darling qualities idolized as
virtues, while others, which could not
be mistaken for vices, have been tacitly
scorned as only fit to occupy grovelling
minds, and avert reproach
from those who could not aspire to
praise.</p>

<p>Among the latter we discover Frugality.
What writer has ever thought
of making his hero an economist?
With a disposition to avoid unnecessary
expense, it has long been assumed
that a sordid and despicable parsimony
must invariably be found, and
the world has been accustomed to
bestow its tenderest sympathies on
the gay, florid, open-hearted rake,
who having manifested a disposition
to give, where he had nothing of his
own to bestow, ruined those honest
tradesmen who were credulous
enough to trust him, and qualified
himself for genteel society by visiting
the King's Bench or the Fleet;
while the man who disdained to be
generous at the expense of others,
who would not affect splendour which
his means were inadequate to sustain,
in fine, who denied himself enjoyments
for which he could not honestly
pay, has been treated with unsparing
ridicule as a mean and pitiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
plodder. Our citizens and traders
have wisely joined to laugh this character
out of countenance, and to applaud
the swindling pleasantries of a
profligate. Let them look to the effects
of this&mdash;let them look to their
legers, and see if they have not been
merry <em>at their own expense</em>.</p>

<p>If there be any truth in the remark
dropped by one of the greatest
ornaments of British literature, that
"it would be well if fewer possessed
the superfluities, and more the comforts
of life;" in times like the present,
it is desirable that mankind
should be weaned from the admiration
of that which ought never to
have been defended&mdash;that madness
and dishonesty should no longer be
depicted as the gracefully irregular
flow of youthful gayety; and that the
modest virtues which find a friend in
the author of "Lessons on Thrift,"
should be recalled from that exile to
which they were doomed by sordid
dissipation and unreflecting folly.</p>

<p>But we must explain, as we proceed,
to guard against mistake or representation.
We do not wish to
return to that enviable state, which
we suppose some of our radical
neighbours contemplate, when they
talk of a "state of nature;" namely,
that in which the first inhabitants of
this island found themselves embowered
in their native woods. We do
not sigh for that economical simplicity
which, according to Richard de
Cirencester, made blue paint, applied
to the human body, a substitute
for clothing; nor do we even lift our
voices against that most effeminate
piece of luxury, as it was considered
by some at the commencement of
Queen Elizabeth's reign&mdash;the introduction
of <em>chimneys to houses</em>. The
votaries of luxury may think that, in
the last instance, we make but a very
slight concession; but the frightful
effects of that departure from old
English habits was once thought very
alarming. We read in Hollingshed:&mdash;"Now
have we many chimneys;
and yet our tender limbs complain of
rheums, catarrhs, and pozes; then
had we none but reredosses, and our
heads did never ache. For as the
smoke in those days was supposed to
be a sufficient hardening for the timber
of the house, so it was reputed a
far better medicine to keep the good
man and his family from the quack or
poze, wherewith, as then, very few
were acquainted."</p>

<p>With all our reverence for economy,
assuredly there are practitioners
of the present day whom we would
prefer to <em>Dr. Smoke</em>; even though
calling in the former, we must submit
to the inconvenience of offering a
fee. We do not sigh for the return
of those golden days, when our wise
progenitors made the same aperture
act the double part of a window and
a chimney, and when a log of wood
was considered an excellent pillow;
but sometimes when our reluctant
hands are a little embarrassed to find
the expected fee, or our purses feel
most <em>awkwardly convenient</em> for the
pocket, after settling the lengthened
bill, we do regret that those who prescribe
for us, when indisposed, must
at the same time prescribe for their
own horses and carriages, and that
the period is gone by when a sufferer
could hope for relief from the pill
of a pedestrian.</p>

<p>Our author, to show the evil effects
of luxury and extravagance, even in a
national point of view, gives the following
narrative:</p>

<p>"The Seven United Provinces
were at the height of their power
and prosperity about 1650, before
England, recovering from a destructive
civil war, began to reclaim the
dominion of the ocean.</p>

<p>"But in their successful periods
the private virtues had also their
share, and parsimony, as usual produced
wealth and industry. In a conversation
at Rotterdam this subject
was discussed; and as the parties
mostly imputed the decline of their
republic to political causes, an opulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
merchant said, that if the company
would dine with him on such a
day, he would convince them that
there were other causes more in their
power.</p>

<p>"The invitation was accepted, and
it was hoped that the merchant would
explain his sentiments, by which they
might improve their speculations in
commerce over a glass of wine, after
an elegant repast as he was accustomed
to give. But what was their
surprise to find nothing on the table
but salted herrings and table beer!
They ate, however, a morsel in silence
and dissatisfaction, which the master
seemed not to observe, praying them
repeatedly to eat and push the glass.
At length, when they began to look
at their watches, the master ordered
in the dinner. At this word they
brightened up, when in came a leg of
mutton, boiled with turnips, and a pot
or two of strong beer. This dish was
little more satisfactory than the other,
as they expected very different fare
in such a magnificent house. There
was, however, a great sacrifice of
conscience and veracity in praising
the mutton and the beer. But some
yawned, and half the <em>gigot</em> remained
even among a numerous company,
when the master, seeing their distress,
nodded unnoticed to an old hoary-headed
domestic, who alone had appeared
along with the mutton, and
who stood respectfully at the sideboard
to serve the bread or the beer.
He went out, and the company was
left to a languid conversation; their
eyes saying more than their tongues.</p>

<p>"On a sudden the folding doors
opened, and a train of twelve servants
entered, bearing on massy plate the
choicest fish, flesh, fowl, all the delicacies
of the season. Two without livery
took their places behind their
master; the others in splendid uniform
behind the guests. The number of
wines presented was computed at fifteen,
and even the richest guests were
astonished at the splendour and variety
of the festival.</p>

<p>"When an equal dessert was served,
and the wine began to circulate,
a prudent and wary guest thought it
was time to request our opulent merchant
to explain his sentiments, as he
had promised. All were fixed in
mute attention when he made this
memorable answer: 'Gentlemen,
my sentiments are already explained;
the lesson is already given. When
our ancestors were gradually rising
to wealth under the yoke of Burgundy,
Austria, Spain, their frugality was
contented with our first dish, and they
even blessed the inventor. In their
second period, when the noble house
of Orange, when Maurice of Nassau
was establishing our power in the
East and West Indies, and commercial
wealth began to overflow all our
ports and canals, still habits of prudence
occasioned economy, and our
rich senators dined on plain mutton,
and drank wholesome beer. The
dinner I have had the honour to give
you is a very moderate specimen of
our present existence. Add the luxury
and pomp of houses, furniture
and equipages, and judge, as you well
can, of the difference of expense&mdash;a
difference which, I would venture to
say, would have, even for one year,
been regarded as a fortune by our
bearded ancestors.'"</p>

<h2>BEAUTIES OF THE MICROSCOPE.</h2>


<p>Nothing can be more curious than
the appearance exhibited by <em>mouldiness</em>,
when viewed through a microscope.
If looked at by the naked
eye, it seems nothing but an irregular
tissue of filaments; but the magnifying
glass shows it to be a forest of
small plants, which derive their nourishment
from the moist substance
which serves them as a base. The
stems of these plants may be plainly
distinguish; and sometimes their
buds, some shut and some open. They
have much similarity to mushrooms,
the tops of which, when they come
to maturity, emit an exceedingly fine
dust which is their seed. Mushrooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
it is well known, are the
growth of a single night; but those
in miniature, of which we are speaking,
seem to come to perfection in a
much less space of time than that;
hence we account for the extraordinary
progress which mouldiness makes
in a few hours. Another curious observation
of the same kind is, that M. Ahlefeld,
seeing some stones covered
with a sort of dust, had the curiosity to
examine it with a microscope, and he
found that it consisted of small microscopic
mushrooms, raised on pedicles,
the heads of which, round the middle,
were turned up at the edges. They
were striated also from the centre to
the circumference, as certain kinds
of mushrooms are. He further remarked,
that they contained, above
their upper covering, a multitude of
small grains shaped like cherries
somewhat flattened, which he suspected
were the seeds; and finally
he observed, among the forest of
mushrooms, several small red insects,
which probably fed upon them.</p>

<p>The <i>lycoperdon</i>, or puff-ball, is a
plant of the fungus kind, which grows
in the form of a tubercle, covered
with small grains, very like chagreen.
If pressed, it bursts, and emits an exceedingly
fine kind of dust, which
flies off under the appearance of
smoke. If some of the dust be examined
with the microscope, it appears
to consist of perfectly round
globules, of an orange colour, the diameter
of which is only about the
1-50th part of the thickness of a hair,
so that each grain of this dust is but
the 1-125000th part of a globule,
equal in diameter to the breadth of a
hair.</p>

<p>The <i>farina of flowers</i> is found to
be regularly and uniformly organized
in each kind of plant. In the mallow,
for example, each grain is an opaque
ball, covered over with small points.
The farina of the tulip, and of most
of the liliaceous kind of flowers,
bears a striking resemblance to the
seeds of a cucumber: that of the
poppy is very like grains of barley,
with a longitudinal groove in them.</p>

<p>There are certain plants, the leaves
of which seem to be pierced with a
multitude of small holes. Of this
kind is the <i>hypericum</i>, or St. John's
wort. Now, if a fragment of this be
viewed with a good microscope, the
supposed holes are found to be vesicles,
contained in the thickness of the
leaf, and covered with an extremely
thin membrane; and these are thought
to be the receptacles which contain
the essential and aromatic oil peculiar
to the plant.</p>

<p>The view exhibited by those plants
which have down, such as borage, nettles,
&amp;c. is exceedingly curious.&mdash;When
examined by a microscope,
they appear to be covered with spikes.
Those of borage are, for the most
part, bent so as to form an elbow;
and though really very close, they appear
by the microscope, to be at a
considerable distance from each other.
The entire appearance is very similar
to that of the skin of the porcupine.</p>

<p>If a needle be viewed through a
microscope, though exceedingly fine,
it is well known the point will appear
quite blunt, more like a peg, broken
at the end, than a sharp pointed steel
needle. The edge of the finest set
razor, when seen through a microscope,
will appear more like the back
of a penknife, full of irregularities,
than what it really is. In these respects
the works of art, when carried to the
highest pitch of perfection, will not
bear to be compared with the operations
of nature. The latter, exposed
to the microscope, instead of losing
their lustre and high polish, appear
so much the more beautiful and perfect
in regularity and order. When
the eyes of a fly are illuminated by
means of a lamp or candle, and viewed
through this instrument, each of
them shows an image of the taper
with a precision and vivacity which
nothing can equal.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of <em>sand</em>, viz.
the calcareous and the vitrifiable: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
former, examined with a microscope,
resembles large irregular fragments
of rock; but the latter appears like
so many rough diamonds. In some
instances, the particles of sand seem
to be highly polished and brilliant,
like an assemblage of diamonds, rubies,
and emeralds.</p>

<p>Charcoal is a fine object for the
microscope. It is found full of
pores, regularly arranged, and passing
through its whole length.</p>

respected lad&mdash;and think no more of
your rheumatism. That, believe me,
is a mere trifle; but think of what you
have been doing, since the peace of
1763, (in that year were you born,)
in the eating and drinking way, and
tremble. I know, my dear Kit, that
you never were a gormandizer, nor a
sot; neither surely was I&mdash;but it matters
not&mdash;the most abstemious of us
all have gone through fearful trials,
and I have not skill in figures to cast
up the poisonous contents of my hapless
stomach for nearly threescore
years. You would not know me now;
I had not the slightest suspicion of
myself in the looking-glass this morning.
Such a face! so wan and wobegone!
No such person drew Priam's
curtains at dead of night, or
could have told him half his Troy
was burned.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;hear me come to the point.
I remember now, perfectly well, that
I have been out of sorts all my lifetime;
and the causes of my continual
illness have this day been revealed to
me. May my melancholy fate be a
warning to you, and all your clear contributors,
a set of men whom the world
could ill spare at this crisis. Mr.
Editor&mdash;<span class="smcap">I have been poisoned.</span></p>

<p>You must know that I became personally
acquainted a few weeks ago,
quite accidentally, with that distinguished
chymist, well known in our
metropolis by the name of "Death in
the Pot."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He volunteered a visit to
me at breakfast, last Thursday, and I
accepted him. Just as I had poured
out the first cup of tea, and was extending
it graciously towards him, he
looked at me, and with a low, hoarse,
husky voice, like Mr. Kean's, asked
me if I were not excessively ill? I had
not had the least suspicion of being so&mdash;but
there was a terrible something
in "Death in the Pot's" face which
told me I was a dead woman. I immediately
got up&mdash;I mean strove to
get up, to ring the bell for a clergyman&mdash;but
I fainted away. On awaking
from my swoon, I beheld "Death
in the Pot" still staring with his fateful
eyes&mdash;and croaking out, half in
soliloquy, half in tête-a-tête, "There
is not a life in London worth ten year's
purchase." I implored him to speak
plainly, and for God's sake not to look
at me so malagrugorously&mdash;and plainly
enough he did then speak to be
sure&mdash;"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Trollope, you are
poisoned.</span>"</p>

<p>"Who," cried I out convulsively,
"who has perpetrated the foul deed?
On whose guilty head will lie my innocent
blood? Has it been from motives
of private revenge? Speak,
Mr. Accum<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;speak! Have you any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
proofs of a conspiracy?" "Yes, Madam,
I have proofs, damning proofs.
Your wine merchant, your brewer,
your baker, your confectioner, your
grocer, aye, your very butcher, are
in league against you; and, Mrs.
Trollope, <span class="smcap">YOU ARE POISONED!</span>"&mdash;"When!&mdash;Oh!
when was the fatal
dose administered? Would an emetic
be of no avail? Could you not yet administer
a&mdash;&mdash;" But here my voice
was choked, and nothing was audible,
Mr. North, but the sighs and sobs of
your poor Trollope.</p>

<p>At last I became more composed&mdash;and
Mr. Accum asked me what was,
in general, the first thing I did on rising
from bed in the morning. Alas!
I felt that it was no time for delicacy,
and I told him at once, that it was to
take off a bumper of brandy for a complaint
in my stomach. He asked to
look at the bottle. I brought it forth
from the press in my own number,
that tall square tower-like bottle, Mr.
North, so green to the eye and smooth
to the grasp. You know the bottle
well&mdash;it belonged to my mother before
me. He put it to his nose&mdash;he
poured out a driblet into a teaspoon as
cautiously as if it had been the black
drop&mdash;he tasted it&mdash;and again repeated
these terrible words, "Mrs. <span class="smcap">Trollope,
you are poisoned.</span> It has," he
continued, "a peculiar disagreeable
smell, like the breath of habitual
drunkards." "Oh! thought I, has it
come to this! The smell ever seemed
to my unsuspecting soul most fragrant
and delicious." "Death in the Pot"
then told me, that the liquid I had
been innocently drinking every morn
for thirty years was not brandy at all,
but a vile distillation of British molasses
over wine lees, rectified over
quick lime, and mixed with saw-dust.
And this a sad, solitary, unsuspecting
spinster had been imbibing as brandy
for so many years! A gleam of comfort
now shot across my brain&mdash;I told
Mr. Accum that I had, during my
whole life, been in the habit of taking
a smallish glass of Hollands before
going to bed, which I fain hoped
might have the effect of counteracting
the bad effects of the forgery that had
been committed against me. I produced
the bottle&mdash;the white globular
one you know. "Death in the Pot"
tried and tasted&mdash;and alas! instead of
Hollands, pronounced it vile British
malt spirit, fined by a solution of sub-acetate
of lead, and then a solution of
alum&mdash;and strengthened with grains
of paradise, Guinea pepper, capsicum,
and other acrid and aromatic substances.
These are learned words&mdash;but
they made a terrible impression
upon my memory. Mr. Accum is a
most amiable man, I well believe&mdash;but
he is a stranger to pity. "Mrs.
Trollope, <span class="smcap">YOU HAVE BEEN POISONED</span>,"
was all he would utter. Had the
brandy and Hollands been genuine,
there would have been no harm&mdash;but
they were <em>imitation</em>, and "<span class="smcap">YOU ARE
POISONED</span>."</p>

<p>Feeling myself very faint, I asked,
naturally enough for a woman in my
situation, for a glass of wine. It was
brought&mdash;but Mr. Accum was at hand
to snatch the deadly draught from my
lips. He tasted what used to be called
my genuine old port,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And in the scowl of heaven his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew black as he was sipping."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"It is spoiled elder wine&mdash;rendered
astringent by oak-wood, saw-dust, and
the husks of filberts&mdash;lead and arsenic,
madam, are&mdash;&mdash;" but my ears
tingled, and I heard no more. I confessed
to the amount of six glasses a
day of this hellish liquor&mdash;pardon my
warmth&mdash;and that such had been my
allowance for many years. My thirst
was now intolerable, and I beseeched
a glass of beer. It came, and "Death
in the Pot" detected at once the murderous
designs of the brewer. Coculus
indicus, Spanish juice, hartshorn
shavings, orange powder, copperas,
opium, tobacco, nux vomica&mdash;such
were the shocking words he kept
repeating to himself&mdash;and then again,
"Mrs. <span class="smcap">Trollope is poisoned</span>."&mdash;"May
I not have a single cup of tea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Mr. Accum," I asked imploringly,
and the chymist shook his head. He
then opened the tea-caddy, and emptying
its contents, rubbed my best
green tea between his hard horny
palms. "Sloe-leaves, and white-thorn
leaves, madam, coloured with
Dutch pink, and with the fine green
bloom of verdigris! Much, in the
course of your regular life, you must
have swallowed!" "Might I try the
coffee?" Oh! Mr. North, Mr. North,
you know my age, and never once, during
my whole existence, have I tasted
coffee. I have been deluded by pease
and beans, sand, gravel, and vegetable
powder! Mr. Accum called it sham
coffee, most infamous stuff, and unfit
for human food! Alas! the day that
I was born! In despair I asked for a
glass of water, and just as the sparkling
beverage was about to touch my
pale quivering lips, my friend, for I
must call him so in spite of every
thing, interfered, and tasting it, squirted
out of his mouth, with a most
alarming countenance. "It comes
out of a lead cistern&mdash;it is a deadly
poison." Here I threw myself on my
knees before this inexorable man, and
cried, "Mr. Death in the Pot, is there
in heaven, on earth, or the waters under
the earth, any one particle of matter
that is not impregnated with death?
What means this desperate mockery?
For mercy's sake give me the very
smallest piece of bread and cheese, or
I can support myself no longer. Are
we, or are we not, to have a morsel
of breakfast this day?" He cut off
about an inch long piece of cheese
from that identical double Gloucester
that you yourself, Mr. North, chose
for me, on your last visit to London,
and declared that it had been rendered
most poisonous by the anotta used
to colour it. "There is here, Mrs.
Trollope, a quantity of red lead&mdash;Have
you, madam, never experienced
after devouring half a pound of this
cheese, an indescribable pain in the
region of the abdomen and of the stomach,
accompanied with a feeling of
tension, which occasioned much restlessness,
anxiety, and repugnance to
food? Have you never felt, after a
Welsh rabbit of it, a very violent cholic?"
"Yes! yes!&mdash;often, often!"
I exclaimed. "And did you use
pepper and mustard?" "I did even
so." "Let me see the castors." I
rose from my knees&mdash;and brought
them out. He puffed out a little
pepper into the palm of his hand, and
went on as usual. "This, madam,
is spurious pepper altogether&mdash;it is
made up of oil cakes, (the residue of
linseed, from which the oil has been
pressed,) common clay, and, perhaps,
a small portion of Cayenne pepper,
(itself probably artificial or adulterated,)
to make it pungent. But now
for the mustard"&mdash;at this juncture
the servant maid came in, and I told
her that I was poisoned&mdash;she set up a
prodigious scream, and Mr. Accum
let fall the mustard pot on the carpet.
But it is needless for me to prolong
the shocking narrative. They assisted
me to get into bed, from which I
never more expect to rise. My eyes
have been opened, and I see the horrors
of my situation. I now remember
the most excruciating cholic, and
divers other pangs which I thought
nothing of at the time, but which must
have been the effect of the deleterious
solids and liquids which I was
daily introducing into my stomach.&mdash;It
appears that I have never, so much
as once, either eat or drank a real
thing&mdash;that is, a thing being what it
pretended to be. Oh! the weight of
lead and copper that has passed thro'
my body! Oh! too, the gravel and
the sand! But is impossible to deceive
me now. This very evening
some bread was brought to me&mdash;Bread!
I cried out indignantly&mdash;Take
the vile deception out of my
sight. Yes, my dear Kit, it was a
villanous loaf of clay and alum! But
my resolution is fixed, and I hope to
die in peace. Henceforth, I shall not
allow one particle of matter to descend
into my stomach! Already I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
feel myself "of the earth, earthy."&mdash;Mr.
Accum seldom leaves my bedside&mdash;and
yesterday brought with him
several eatables and drinkables, which
he assured me he had analyzed, subjected
to the test-act, and found them
to be conformists. But I have no trust
in chymistry. His quarter-loaf looked
like a chip cut off the corner of a
stone block. It was a manifest <em>sham
loaf</em>. After being deluded in my
Hollands, bit in my brandy, and having
found my muffins a mockery,
never more shall I be thrown off my
guard. I am waxing weaker and
weaker&mdash;so farewell! Bewildering
indeed has been the destiny of</p>

<h2>VARIATION OF THE NEEDLE.</h2>


<p>It is thought by some surveyors
that a change has taken place in the
variation of the needle, and that the
power of attraction is returning to
the east or right hand. For my own
satisfaction, I have for some years
past been endeavouring to ascertain
the truth of the fact, and my observations
for the last ten years past require
only 20' to be added to strike
the former object. It is well known
that formerly surveyors made an allowance
to the west or left hand, of
one degree, for every 10 or 11 years
for variation, and it now comes short
40' of the common allowance, so
that from the result of my observations
it appears evidently that the
variation is not on the return, but still
increasing, but so slow and variable
every year, that it cannot be ascertained,
unless by a series of experiments.
To corroborate the following
observations, I would remark, that I
have lately read (I think in the Encyclopædia)
of a curious gentlemen
in London, who with a nice instrument,
monthly for a number of years,
made observations upon the variation,
and he seldom found the needle cut
the same degree and minutes, but
varying sometimes to the right, others
to the left: sometimes more, sometimes
less, which shows that the attractive
power is variable.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July, 1810, an object
on the North mountain, 3 and a
half miles off, bore</p>

</table></div>
<p>From whatever cause the variation
of the needle arises, it evidently is
affected by a something within our
earth; but whether from the motion
of two attractive poles, or four, as has
been maintained by great men, or
whether by a concentric globe of elementary
particles composed of electricity
and refined iron, adjusted and
organized in a particular way, are all
hypotheses. The phenomenon of the
dipping needle is a curiosity, and sufficient
to satisfy us that the power of
attraction is about the centre of the
earth, for let a needle be truly balanced
on a centre pin in our latitude,
then give it the polarity necessary,
the north end will dip about fifty degrees;&mdash;move
it to the equator it will
become again level;&mdash;carry it still
southward, the south end will dip.</p>

<p>When effects are obvious, man
more curious than wise, endeavours
to search out the cause, and in some
things we may be successful,&mdash;others
are beyond our knowledge, and hid
in the mysteries of Nature's God.</p>

<h2>FRENCH WOMEN.</h2>

<p class="center">From Sketches of French Manners and Customs.</p>


<p>The women do not, as in England,
employ themselves solely in household
and nursery affairs, but they mix
themselves in all the cares of their
husbands, and assist them in their
trade and business, whatever it may
be.&mdash;Thus they are constantly found
in the counting houses and shops;
and they know as much, and often
more, of the details of a trade, than
their husbands. In Dieppe, every
variety of shop and trade had a woman
assisting in it, who, from her
appearance, might generally be considered
as the mistress of the family.
At a blacksmith's shop, for instance,
I saw a neatly dressed woman, with a
very clean cap shoeing a horse; and,
passing a second time, I saw her
filing at a vice. I expressed my astonishment
to the neighbours, but
they seemed rather disposed to laugh
at me, than to join in my laugh at the
woman. I learnt that she was a
widow, and thus kept up her husband's
trade, to rear a large family.
In Paris, I complimented a pretty wife
of an eminent bookseller for her
knowledge of the prices of paper,
printing, and engraving, in which
she several times corrected errors of
her husband. I remarked, that the
French ladies must have great talents
thus to learn a trade in the honey
moon, which had employed their
husbands during an apprenticeship
of seven years; and that I supposed
she would be equally expert at any
other trade, if, on becoming a widow,
she married a husband in some other
line. "Ah! Monsieur," said she,
"we endeavour to assist our spouses
in every way in our power;&mdash;it is our
only pleasure; their cares are our
cares, and their interests are ours;
and, if it is our calamity to become
widows, and we meet with another
good husband, we do the best we
can for him also."</p>

<h2>LIFE.</h2>

<p>When I look upon the tombs of
the great, every emotion of envy
dies; when I read the epitaphs of
the beautiful, every inordinate desire
forsakes me; when I meet with
the grief of parents upon a tombstone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
my heart melts with compassion;
when I see the tombs of the parents
themselves, I feel how vain it is to
grieve for those whom we must
quickly follow; when I behold rival
kings lying side by side, or the holy
men who divided the world with their
contests and disputes, I reflect with
sorrow and astonishment on the frivolous
competitions, factions, and debates
of mankind; when I read the several
dates of the tombs,&mdash;of some who
died yesterday, and some six hundred
years ago, I am reminded of that
day when all mankind will be contemporaries,
and make their appearance
together.</p>

<h2>STATISTICS OF EUROPE.</h2>

<h3>From a French paper.</h3>


<p>Europe contains in superfices,
153,559 square geographic miles, of
15 to a degree, or only 1116 of the
continental superfices of the whole
earth. Its population is estimated at
180 millions and a half; which gives,
one with another, 1177 inhabitants to
each square geographic mile. It
should always be remembered, that
this population is very unequally divided;

<p>In classing out each state according
to its superfices, its population, its ordinary
revenues, and the contributive
proportion of each individual towards
the public burdens, we find that they
should occupy the following order.</p>

<p><i>Superfices.</i>&mdash;1st, Russia; 2d, Sweden;
3d, Austria; 4th, France; 5th,
Turkey; 6th, Spain; 7th, Great Britain;
8th, Prussia; 9th, Germany;
10th, Denmark; 11th, the Two Sicilies;
12th, Portugal; 13th, Sardinia;
14th, the Netherlands; 15th, Switzerland;
16th, the Ecclesiastical
States; and 17th, Tuscany, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;1st, Russia; second,
France; 3d, Austria; 4th, Great
Britain; 5th, Germany; 6th, Spain;
7th, Prussia; 8th, Turkey; 9th, the
Two Sicilies; 10th, the Netherlands;
11th, Sardinia; 12th, Portugal; 13th,
Sweden; 14th, the Ecclesiastial States;
15th, Switzerland; 16th, Denmark;
17th, Tuscany, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Revenue.</i>&mdash;1st, Great Britain; 2d,

Sicilies; 12th, Sardinia; 13th, Sweden;
14th, Denmark; 15th, the Ecclesiastical
States; 16th, Tuscany;
and 17th, Switzerland, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Contributive Portion on each Individual
towards the public charges.</i>&mdash;-This
last calculation is the most curious.
It demonstrates what each individual
pays annually one with another,&mdash;namely,
in England, 52f. 5c.; in
the Netherlands, 38f. 5c.; in France,
19f. 71c.; in Germany, 16f. 6c.; in
Russia, 15f. 88c.; in Denmark, 14f
60c; Portugal, 13f. 85c.; in Spain,
17f. 60c; in Sardinia, 12f. 5c; in
Austria, 11f. 68c.; in the Ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>

in Tuscany, 9f. 12c; in Turkey, 9f.
4c.; in the Two Sicilies, 7f. 97c.;
and in Switzerland, 5f. 47c. This last
is the weakest of all European states.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANY.</h2>


<p><i>Mode of engraving union steel and
then transferring the same to steel or
other metals.</i>&mdash;This invention deservedly
demands while it receives the admiration
of every lover of the Fine
Arts; and at the same time it presents
the means of perpetuating whatever
is beautiful in the art of engraving,
and will probably produce a general
refinement in the state of the
public by furnishing engravings of the
most beautiful kinds, at the same cost
as those of inferior execution.</p>

<p>This invention promises to be of
great advantage to some of our manufacturers,
particularly that of pottery,
which may now be embellished with
beautiful engravings, so as to place
the successful competition of other
nations at a more distant period. It
may also be applied with great advantage
to <em>calico</em> printing, by producing
entire new patterns upon the cylinders
from which they are printed,
an object of great importance to our
manufacturing interest. These are
among its obvious applications; but
as a means of rendering forgery <em>impracticable</em>,
it claims the attention of
statesmen and the gratitude of philanthropists,
who shudder at the hundreds
of victims which are now immolated
to the laws by the facility
with which they may be violated.</p>

<p>The association of Mr. Charles
Heath with the American inventors
is a fortunate circumstance, as it affords
a pledge, that all which is exquisite
in art will be combined with
the ingenious mechanical inventions
of Mr. Perkins, and the perseverance
of Mr. Fairman; and the means of
conferring every desirable perfection
on various applications of the Siderographic
process.</p>


<p><i>Great Britain and the U. States.</i>&mdash;(A
Contrast.)&mdash;A correspondent observes,
that from an article in the last
Inquirer, taken from a London paper,
it is computed that the expense of the
approaching coronation of his Britannic
Majesty, George IV., will exceed
eight hundred thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p>This, at $4 44 cents the pound
sterling, amounts to the moderate sum
of three millions five hundred and fifty
two thousand dollars, of the currency
of the United States.</p>

<p>This sum would pay the salaries of
the President of the U. States for a
succession of <em>one hundred and forty-two
years</em>,&mdash;and leave a balance of
two thousand dollars remaining.</p>

<p class="sig">
[<i>Richmond Com.</i><br />
</p>


<p><i>English Churn.</i>&mdash;An improvement
has been made in England in the construction
of the dasher of the churn,
which "is made to turn on a pivot,
fixed in the lower end of the handle,
and consists of two pieces set crosswise,
so as to form four wings, diagonally
shaped, and something similar
to those of a windmill. Let the wings
be about two inches wide, proportioned
in length to the dimensions of the
churn, and of such a level as gives
them an inclination of about forty-five
degrees.</p>

<p>The pivot on which the wings turn
to be of iron, otherwise it will soon
wear out."</p>

<p>The above plan is more efficacious
than any other, and requires the operation
to be moderately performed
lest the butter come too soon, and
therefore become swetted.</p>


<p><i>Watermelon Sirup.</i>&mdash;Those of our
readers who may not be acquainted
with the fact, but yet are friendly to
domestic economy, are informed, that
one gallon of watermelon-juice will,
by boiling, afford one pint of pure
sirup, preferable either to honey or
molasses, for domestic or medical
purposes. The trial is easily made,
and the expense trifling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>


<p><i>Patent Churn.</i>&mdash;A churn has been
invented by a young man in Vermont,
which answers every purpose with a
very trifling labour. It stands perpendicularly,
and is perfectly tight.&mdash;The
operation is performed by a person
sitting near the churn and working
the machine by each hand, as you
work a pump. The dasher is turned
by means of two leather straps, which
are fastened at one end of the upright
cylinder, and passing each once round
it in opposite directions, are fastened
at the other end of the handle on each
side of the upright. So that the stroke
with one hand turns the dasher once
round, and that with the other turns it
back.</p>


<p><i>Socrates.</i>&mdash;One day when Alcibiades
was boasting of his wealth and the
great estates in his possession, (which
generally blow up the pride of young
people of quality,) Socrates carried
him to a geographical map, and asked
him to find Attica. It was so small,
it could scarcely be discerned upon
the draft; he found it, however,
though with some difficulty. But,
upon being desired to point out his
own estate there&mdash;"It is too small,"
says he, "to be distinguished in so
little a space."</p>

<p>"See then," replied
Socrates, "how much you are affected
about an imperceptible point of
the earth."</p>


<p><i>Georgetown, (Ky.) August 3.</i>&mdash;A
white crow was lately shot by Col.
Rhodes Thompson, at his residence,
on Elkhorn, about two and a half
miles from this town. It was examined
by several scientific gentlemen,
and pronounced to be of the crow
species; it resembled the common
black crow in every thing but its colour,
which was of a dingy white.&mdash;Col.
Thompson had observed it for
some time among a flock of black
crows, and had ascertained its note to
be the same as theirs.</p>


<p><i>Scotch Adventurers.</i>&mdash;The character
which the Scotch have acquired,
beyond almost any other people, for
the art of pushing their fortune abroad,
was never perhaps more singularly
illustrated than by the following anecdote,
which Dr. Anderson relates in
his "Bee," on the authority of a baronet
of scientific eminence.</p>

<p>The Russians and Turks, in the
war of 1739, having diverted themselves
long enough in the contest,
agreed to treat for peace. The commisioners,
for this purpose, were
marshal Gen. Keith, on the part of
Russia, and the grand vizier on that
of the Turks. These personages
met, and carried on their negotiations
by means of interpreters. When
all was concluded, they rose to separate:
the marshal made his bow,
with his hat in his hand, and the vizier
his salam, with his turban on
his head. But when these ceremonies
of taking leave were over, the
vizier turned suddenly, and coming
up to marshal Keith, took him cordially
by the hand, and in the broadest
Scotch dialect, declared warmly
that it made him "unco happy to
meet a countryman in his exalted station."
Keith started with astonishment,
eager for an explanation of the
mystery, when the vizier added,
"Dinna be surprised, mon, I'm o'
the same country wi' yoursel'. I
mind weel seeing you and your brother,
when boys, passin by to the
school at Kirkaldy; my father, Sir,
was <em>bellman of Kirkaldy</em>." What
more extraordinary can be imagined,
than to behold in the plenipotentiaries
of two mighty nations, two foreign
adventurers, natives of the same
mountainous territory; nay, of the
very same village!&mdash;What indeed
more extraordinary, unless it be the
spectacle of a Scotchman turned
Turk for the sake of honours, held
on the tenure of a caprice from which
even Scotch prudence can be no guarantee!</p>


<p><i>Garrick.</i>&mdash;Mr. Twiss, a romancing
traveller, was talking of a church he
had seen in Spain which was a mile
and a half long. "Bless me, (cried
Garrick,) how broad was it?" "About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
ten yards," said Twiss. "This is,
you'll observe, gentlemen, (said Garrick
to the company,) not a round lie,
but differs from his other stories,
which are generally as broad as they
are long."</p>


<p><i>Franklin Donation Fund.</i>&mdash;The
trustees of the fund established by
Dr. Franklin, for the benefit of young
married mechanics, in Boston, give
notice, that they will make loans, in
sums not exceeding 200 dollars to
one individual, on the terms prescribed
by Dr. Franklin, viz.</p>

<p>"The applicant must be a married
mechanic, under the age of 25 years,
who has faithfully served an apprenticeship
of five years at least, in the
town of Boston. He must produce
a certificate of his moral character,
from at least two respectable citizens
of said town, who are willing to become
bound with him, to the trustees,
for the repayment of the sum loaned,
by annual instalments of 10 per cent.
with interest annually, at the rate of
5 per cent."</p>


<p><i>Flour.</i>&mdash;Flour has recently been
sold at Cincinnati for $2.25 per bbl.
"good money." The crops of grain
have been exceedingly heavy in the
western country.</p>


<p><i>Herculaneum Manuscripts.</i>&mdash;Sir
Humphrey Davy has had great success
in unrolling the manuscripts of
Herculaneum and Pompeii. In a
short time the contents of each roll will
be known, as well as its title, which
is generally found in the interiour.</p>


<p><i>Whaling!</i>&mdash;It would seem by the
following articles from the Boston
Patriot, that the invention of the torpedo
by the late Robert Fulton, to
destroy enemies' ships in the late war,
is about to be made use of for another
valuable purpose, viz. blowing
up whales!</p>

<p>"It was hardly to have been expected,
that these destructive engines
should have been adopted in the prosecution
of one of the most thriving
branches of business in which navigation
is now employed. Yet, we are
informed that a vessel has recently
been fitted at New Bedford, bound
on a whaling cruise, with an apparatus
on board for the purpose of taking
whales by <em>blowing them up</em>.</p>

<p>"Torpedoes, of arrow form, are
thrown from a gun on board the vessel,
which are calculated to sink into
the body of the whale, and there explode.
As the experiment has not
yet been fully tested, we think its
success, to say, the least, is problematical."</p>


<p><i>New York school fund, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;We
have a long and interesting statement
in the New York papers, of the funds
set apart for literary purposes. They
chiefly consist of bonds and mortgages,
for money loaned, a considerable
quantity of bank stocks, and sundry
valuable tracts of land. The amounts
are as follows:</p>

<p>The fund for the support of "common
schools" is equal to $1,232,908,
and its annual product about $78,964.</p>

<p>The fund for the "promotion of
literature" amounts to $201,439, and
its income is $5,288. This fund is
divided among the colleges, in proportion
to their scholars. Both of
these funds are on the increase as to
value and product.</p>

<p>Besides,&mdash;the occasional grants of
the legislature for literary purposes
since 1790, amounts to $1,189,056.
And the general aggregate of appropriations,
for the last thirty years, including
escheated lands, schools lots,
fees, &amp;c., but excluding the annual
revenue derived from the permanent
funds, is estimated to amount to
3,000,000 of dollars!</p>


<p><i>Premiums.</i>&mdash;At a meeting of the
Merino Society in London, 12th May,
after awarding the prizes to the best
show of sheep and superfine broadcloth,
the premium of ten guineas
for worsted yarn, was adjudged to Mr.
J. Head, of Kirkstall, near Leeds, for
one pound of wool spun by a newly
invented machine, which was superior
in fineness to any heretofore seen,
and peculiarly adapted for the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
bombazeens, &amp;c. It produced 95
hanks of 530 yards each in length,
equal to 30 miles and 400 yards, to a
pound of wool.</p>


<p><i>Salt mines of Meurthe.</i>&mdash;The researches
for the discovery of rock
salt, which commenced in July last,
at Moyenire, in the department of
La Meurthe, in France, are carried
on to advantage. After exploring to
the depth of 200 feet, and reaching
the first layer, which is 11 feet in
thickness, the workmen had to perforate
a bed of gypsum and clay of
five hundred and forty-six feet, when
they came to a second stratum of
salt, eight feet in thickness. It is intended
to remove the researches to
two other neighbouring points, to ascertain
the breadth and magnitude of
the whole bed. The two points form
a triangle nearly equilateral, each side
of which may be about 6 or 700 toises
in length. One of these points is the
city of Vic, and the other to the south
of it. On this latter point they have
already pierced to the depth of 26
feet of vegetable earth: the orifice of
each bore is 3<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> inches, which constantly
fills up with fresh water. The
salt of the first bed is extremely white,
and transparent as rock crystal. It
is likewise very pure, and free from
every noxious or terrene substance.
The second appears to be intermixed
with gypseous or argillaceous substance,
but a very small proportion.
This salt is brown, not unlike a clouded
flint; both the kinds are very
compact, well crystallized, the fractures
cubical, and the saline taste superior
to that of any salt obtained by
evaporation. It contains but very
little of muriate of magnesia, or of
sulphate of lime.</p>


<p><i>More silver!</i>&mdash;We have the following
account of the discovery of a
silver mine, in a paper printed at Salem,
Indiana, July 10.&mdash;"We have
been informed by gentlemen of credibility,
that there has been a silver
mine lately discovered in the late purchase
in this state. The circumstances
relating to it are these: A few
months ago, a gentleman near the
boundary line, was informed by an
Indian, that there was a mine of this
kind somewhere, but refused to tell
him where it was, unless the man
would pay him fifty dollars, a horse, a
gun and several blankets, which the
man did, and was taken to the place,
and brought away several pounds of
the ore. He has since, we are told,
brought away about 300 pounds. He
refuses to tell where it is, but says
there is at least three wagon loads already
cast into bars by the Indians,
which he intends to bring away. We
have seen (so have several citizens of
Salem) some of the ore, and should
suppose it at least two-thirds silver.
The ore is so pure that it can be
drawn out with the hammer into bars
of almost any size, and it is thought
by some to be sufficiently pure in its
natural state. From the representation
of it, the mine is inexhaustible,
and in a situation difficult to be discovered."</p>

<h2>DIED,</h2>


<p>In England, on the 19th June, at his
house, Spring-grove, near Hounslow,
the venerable president of the Royal
Society, the Right Hon. Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph
Banks</span>, G. C. B. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. The
loss to science by the demise of this
excellent man and liberal patron will
be long and severely felt. Sir Joseph
had been for a long time labouring
under a most distressing illness; for
some years he had been deprived of
the use of his lower extremities, and
rendered so feeble as to be lifted from
his room to his carriage. He possessed
a princely fortune, of which he
assigned a large portion to the encouragement
of science, particularly
natural history, private and public
charities, and domestic hospitality.&mdash;Also,
on the 31st May, <span class="smcap">I. Bradley</span>,
the Yorkshire giant:&mdash;when dead he
measured nine feet in length, and
three feet over the shoulders.</p>

<p class="center">FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">John Logan</span>, the author of the following
touching stanzas, it is well observed by his
biographer <span class="smcap">Chalmers</span>, that it would be difficult
to produce, from the whole range of English
poetry, any thing more exquisitely tender
and pathetic, than some of his productions.&mdash;He
died in London, December, 1788, in the
fortieth year of his age. His end is described
as edifying. When he became too weak to
hold a book, we are told he employed his
time in hearing such young persons as visited
him read the Scriptures.</p>
